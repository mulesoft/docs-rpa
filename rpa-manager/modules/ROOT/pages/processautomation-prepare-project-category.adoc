= Manage Categories

Project managers organize projects into categories. You create a set of categories for them to choose from.

A category describes the environment of a process in a few keywords, for example `Customer Support Mythical University` or `Finance`.

A project can only belong to a single category. First, create a standard category, so the process team can start with process automation quickly. They can change the category of a process later. After they have automated the first few projects, create an archive category to move the completed projects there.
