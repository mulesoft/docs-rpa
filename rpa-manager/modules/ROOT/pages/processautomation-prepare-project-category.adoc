= Manage Categories

Process team members organize projects into categories. 

Manage a set of categories from which process team members can choose one when they create a xref:processevaluation-propose.adoc#create-a-process-evaluation[process evaluation] or an xref:processautomation-manage.adoc#create-an-automation-project[automation project].

A category describes the environment of a process in a few keywords, for example `Customer Support Mythical University` or `Finance`.

A process can only belong to a single category. 

First, create a standard category, so the process team can start with process automation quickly. The team can change the category of a process later. After the team automates the first few projects, create an archive category to move the completed projects there.

The category panel shows the number of contained projects and how many are in development and in production.
