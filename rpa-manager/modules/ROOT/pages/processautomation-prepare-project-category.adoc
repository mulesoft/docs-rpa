= Manage Categories

Process team members organize projects into categories. 

Manage a set of categories from which process team members can choose one when they create a xref:processevaluation-propose.adoc#create-a-process-evaluation[process evaluation] or an xref:processautomation-manage.adoc#create-an-automation-project[automation project].

A category describes the environment of a process in a few keywords, for example `Customer Support Mythical University` or `Finance`.

A process can only belong to a single category. 

First, create a standard category, so the process team can start with process automation quickly. The team can change the category of a process later. After the team automates the first few projects, create an archive category to move the completed projects there.

. Click *OK*.

The category panel shows the number of contained projects and how many are in development and in production.

== Edit a Category

Edit a category to render its name more precisely:

. Open the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click *Edit* (image:edit-icon.png[pen-to-paper symbol,1.5%,1.5%]) on the panel of the category to edit.
. Change the name in the *Edit the category* window.
. Click *OK*.

== Remove a Category

Remove categories that are no longer needed. 

You can only remove categories that do not contain processes.

To remove a category:

. Open the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click *Remove* (image:delete-icon.png[trash symbol,1.5%,1.5%]) on the panel of the category to delete.

== Open a Category

To view the contained projects, open the category:

. Open the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.

The project panels show the data and actions of the project.
