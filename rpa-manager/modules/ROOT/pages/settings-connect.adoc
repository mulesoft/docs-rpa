= Connecting to RPA Processes from Salesforce Products
:page-notice-banner-message: You can now use Connected Apps for a more secure and scalable authentication method than User API Keys.

RPA Manager requires authentication to integrate RPA processes into other Salesforce products. For example, you can use your API key to configure an RPA connector in a MuleSoft Composer flow.

For security reasons, you can only see and copy an API key on creation.

== Before You Begin


* Ask an Anypoint Access Management administrator to assign you the required permissions:

* Users must have an Anypoint account to associate the API key with.
* You must have a secure way to transfer the API Key to the user.
* Users must have a secure place accessible to store their API key.

== Create a User API Key

Create an API key for a user to integrate an RPA process into another Salesforce product. After expiration, the integrated process instance can no longer connect to RPA Manager from other Salesforce products. Edit the API key to move the expiration date. For security reasons, RPA Manager shows the API Key only during creation. Copy the API Key and securely send it to the user. If the user lose an API Key, create a new one.

To create a user API key: 

. Open the *User API Keys* view of the *User Management* module.
. Click *Create*.
. [[form-createuserapikey]] Complete the form *Create User API Key*:
* *User*:
+
Select a user whose identity and permissions are used to connect from another Salesforce products to RPA Manager.
* *Expiration Date*:
+
Select an expiration date for the user API key from the calendar.
. Click *OK*.
. In the window *Key Created!*, click *Copy to clipboard*.
. Copy the API key to a secure place.
. Click *Close*.

Send the user API key to the user in a secure way.

The users can copy their API key into the configuration settings of the Salesforce products into which they want to integrate the RPA processes.

== Edit a User API Key

Edit a user API key to change its name, description, or expiration date. If you lost access to an API key, create a new one.

To edit a user API key:

. Open the *User API Keys* view of the *User Management* module.
. Click the *Edit* icon image:edit-icon.png["pen-to-paper symbol",1.5%,1.5%] on the panel of the user API key to edit.
. Edit the form *Create User API Key*:
+
For an explanation of the properties, see <<form-createuserapikey, *Create a User API Key*>>.
. Click *Save*.

== Delete a User API Key

Delete a user API key to revoke the user's REST API access to RPA Manager. Integrated processes that use the deleted API key stop working.

To delete a user API key:

. Open the *User API Keys* view of the *User Management* module.
. Click the *Remove* icon image:delete-icon.png["trash can symbol",1.5%,1.5%] on the panel of the user API key to remove.
. Confirm the removal.
