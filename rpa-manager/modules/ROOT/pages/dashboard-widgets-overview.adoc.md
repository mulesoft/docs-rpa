## Data representation

The dashboard information consists of the contents of various widgets. A widget is a movable and scalable [Panel](../../X1_Server/X1_Server_Basics/GUI/rpa_X1_Server_Basics_GUI_DataRepresentation_EN.md#panels).


## Types of widgets

We can roughly divide widgets into two groups. There are widgets that monitor the current situation and, for which, a shorter analysis interval and more frequent refreshes are appropriate. The second group of widgets enables an overview of the development of process automation over longer time periods.

The widgets that are used to assess the current situation include  **Analysis Packages**, **Current Robot Status**, **Bot Workload**, **Trigger Performance** and **Business Process Performance**. If you keep an eye on these widgets, you can allocate resources flexibly and react quickly to problems.

The widgets that provide a more general overview of the progress of process automation in your company include **Automation Management**, **Profit Analysis: Process Time**, **Profit Analysis: Process Frequency**. These widgets help you to identify unexploited potential and to plan over the long term. You can see at a glance what advantages have accrued from the automation of a Process.


## Description of the widgets

In the following chapters, you can find a detailed description of each widget. Each description includes content and benefits, as well as configuration and drill-down options for the widget.
