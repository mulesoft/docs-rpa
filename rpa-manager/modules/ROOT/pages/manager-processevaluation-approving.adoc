= Approving a Process for Automation

You approve an evaluated process candidate to refer it to a project manager or a center of excellence for automation.

== Before You Begin

* Obtain the privileges you need:
** To approve an automation process for a center of excellence, you must have the privilege *Process Evaluation Approval to a CoE*.
** To approve directly for a project manager, you need the privilege *Process Evaluation Approval to a Project Manager*.
* You can only approve evaluated process candidates.
* You can only refer processes to users tagged as project manager or user groups tagged as center of excellence.

== Select a Process for Approval

You can automate processes with high ratings for feasibility. Consider the benefits before automating a process. Automate simple processes first.

. Filter the process list in the view *Process Evaluation* of the module *Process Evaluation* to show only newly-created evaluations.
. View the *Process Matrix*. If you cannot see it, click the *Expand* image button image:expand-imagebutton.png[less-than symbol in a green half-circle,1.5%,1.5%].
. Hover over the dots to see the names of the corresponding processes.
. Click one of the toggle-dots in the upper right half of the matrix to select it and to display only the corresponding processes.

== Approve a Process

Approve the selected process to refer it to a project manager or a center of excellence for automation.

After approval, the process is also displayed either in the personal backlog of the project manager (*My RPA* - *My Backlog*) or in the team backlog of the center of excellence (*My RPA* - *Team Backlog*).

. In the *Process Evaluation* view of the *Process Evaluation* module, click *Approve* in the table row of the evaluation you want to approve.
. Choose a user or a center of excellence as *Project Manager*.
. Click *OK*.
