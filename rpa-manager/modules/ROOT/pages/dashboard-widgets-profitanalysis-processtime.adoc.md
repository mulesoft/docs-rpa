# <i class="fs fs-lg fs-dashboard"></i> Dashboard - Widgets - Process Time

![rpa_Dashboard_Widgets_ProfitAnalysis_ProcessTime](img/rpa_Dashboard_Widgets_ProfitAnalysis_ProcessTime.png)

The widget **Profit Analysis: Process Time** shows the execution duration of a Process by a Robot compared to the time that a human requires to execute the same Process ([**Manual process execution time**](../../ProcessAutomation/ProcessManagement/rpa_processAutomation_ProcessManagement_Category_Projects_EN.md#manual-process-execution-time_1)).

The times are shown individually for each configuration.

## Data representation

The execution duration of the individual configurations is shown as a [Line Chart](../../X1_Server/X1_Server_Basics/GUI/rpa_X1_Server_Basics_GUI_DataRepresentation_EN.md#linien-diagramme). A colored line corresponds to a configuration.

The time interval is shown on the X axis, the execution duration of the individual runs is shown in seconds on the Y axis.

The manual execution duration in seconds is represented by a horizontal red line.
