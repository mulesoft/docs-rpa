= Preparing Projects

A project defines the framework conditions for the automation of a process and is managed by a team.

Project managers organize projects into categories. RPA administrators create a set of categories. Project managers choose one of the categories when they create an automation  project.

RPA Administrators list available applications and assign them to bots that can access them. Citizen technologists assign required applications to processes. A member of the process team can deploy a process on a bot that has assigned the required processes.
