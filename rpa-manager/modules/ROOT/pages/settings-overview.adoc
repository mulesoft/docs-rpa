:page-notice-banner-message: MuleSoft RPA is integrating with Anypoint Platform to unify the login experience and provide support for external identity providers (IdP). After your organization is migrated to Anypoint Platform, the *Organization Management* module is replaced by the *Settings* module.

The *Settings* module enables you to configure the currency and decimal sign to show in RPA Manager modules and to reassign RPA assets to other RPA users.
