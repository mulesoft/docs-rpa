= Managing Automations

When a project manager clicks the icon *Start automation* in the *My Backlog* view of the *My RPA* module, he creates a categorized process automation project in the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.

If you already have evaluated a process with a third-party tool, you can create or copy an automation project directly inside a category.

You can edit the data of a project.

You can delete a project if it has never been in the production phase.

You can transition projects forward and backward through all life-cycle phases.

* To manage an automation project, a categorized project must exist  in the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.
* To create or copy a project, you must be xref:usermanagement-manage.adoc#designate-a-user-as-project-manager[designated as project manager].
* To transition a project to another phase, obtain the needed permissions as a member of the process team in the xref:processautomation-manage.adoc#create-an-automation-project[project data sheet] in the *Project Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.

== Create an Automation project

When a project manager clicks the icon *Start automation* in the *My Backlog* view of the *My RPA* module, he creates a categorized process automation project in the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.

If you already have evaluated a process with a third-party tool, you can create an automation project directly inside a category:

. In a category in the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module, click *Create*.
. Complete the form *Create process*:
+
include::rpa-manager::partial$form-automationproject.adoc[]
. Click *Save*.

== Copy an Automation project

When a project manager clicks the icon *Start automation* in the *My Backlog* view of the *My RPA* module, he creates a categorized process automation project in the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.

If you already have evaluated a process with a third-party tool, you can copy and edit a similar automation project directly inside a category.

The copy contains all information from the original project including the most recent revision of all workflows with the exception of the bot assignments to test and productive configurations, and the history of the workflows.

To complete copying of the project, first transfer the project to the *Build* phase. Then open it in the MuleSoft RPA Builder. The project then receives its own identification values. The copied project can only transition to the *Test* phase after it has been uploaded from the RPA Builder to the RPA Manager.

Copy an existing similar project to save time:

. In a category in the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module, click the *Copy* icon image:copy-icon.png[copy symbol,1.5%,1.5%] on the panel of the project you want to edit.
. Complete the form *Create process*:
+
include::rpa-manager::partial$form-automationproject.adoc[]
. Click *Save*.
. Open the project in xref:rpa-builder::index.adoc[MuleSoft RPA Builder] and upload it to RPA Manager.

== Edit an Automation Project

Edit an automation project to update it:

. In a category in the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module, click the *Edit* icon image:edit-icon.png[pen-to-square symbol,1.5%,1.5%] on the panel of the project you want to edit.
. Complete the form *Create process*:

include::rpa-manager::partial$form-automationproject.adoc[]
. Click *Save*.

== Change the Process Owner of an Automation Project

Change the owner of a process to represent changed responsibilities:

. In a category in the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module, click





The new process owner is added to the process team with read access.

The previous process owner is removed from the process team independent of their previous authorizations. You can add them again as a team member.

== Change the Project Manager of an Automation Project

The previous manager can be assigned to the Process as a team member.
