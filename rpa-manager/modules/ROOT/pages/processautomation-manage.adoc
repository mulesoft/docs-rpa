= Managing Automations

When a project manager clicks the icon *Start automation* for a process in the *My Backlog* view of the *My RPA* module, RPA Manager creates a project for the automation of the process.

To automate a process already evaluated with a third-party tool, a project manager can create an automation project inside a category directly in the *Process Automation* module.

The *Process Management* view shows the projects organized by category.

Within a category, you can manage the process automation projects:

* Create, copy, edit, and delete projects.
* View the status of projects, including financial analysis.
* Transition projects forward and backward through all life-cycle phases.
* Create boards for managing project tasks.

== Before You Begin

* Ask an administrator to xref:usermanagement-manage.adoc#assign-privileges-to-a-user[assign you the required privileges]:

== Create an Automation Project

When a project manager clicks the icon *Start automation* for a process in the *My Backlog* view of the *My RPA* module, RPA Manager creates a project for the automation of the process.

To automate a process already evaluated with a third-party tool, you can create an automation project inside a category directly in the *Process Automation* module:

. Open the *Project Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click on the name of the category in which you want to create the new project.
. In the *<category name>* view, click *Create*.
. [[form-createprocess]] Complete the form *Create process*:
+
include::rpa-manager::partial$form-automationproject.adoc[]
. Click *Save*.

RPA Manager returns to the *<category name>* view. Your new project is sorted into the view according to your workspace settings.

== Copy an Automation Project

A copy of an automation project contains all information from the original project, including the most recent revision of all workflows, with the exception of the bot assignments to test and productive configurations.

Copy a project to automate a similar process more quickly:

. Open the *Project Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click on the name of the category of the project that you want to copy.
. In the *<category name>* view, click *Copy* (image:copy-icon.png[copy symbol,1.5%,1.5%])on the panel of the project you want to copy.
. Check and edit the form *Copy process*:
+
For an explanation of the properties, see <<form-createprocess, *Create process*>>.
. Click *Save*.

To complete copying the project:

. Transfer the project copy to the *Build* phase.
. Open the project copy in the xref:rpa-builder::index.adoc[RPA Builder].
. xref:rpa-builder::ui-overview#menu-bar[Upload] the project copy to RPA Manager.

The project copy then receives its own identification values. 

Only after the copy process completes, the following actions are possible:

* Another process team member can open the project copy in RPA Builder.
* You or another process team member can transition the project copy to the test phase.

== Edit an Automation Project

Edit an automation project to update it:

. Open the *Project Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click on the name of the category of the project.
. In the *<category name>* view, click *Edit* (image:edit-icon.png[pen-to-paper symbol,1.5%,1.5%]) on the panel of the project to edit.
. Check and edit the form *Copy process*:
+
For an explanation of the properties, see <<form-createprocess, *Create process*>>.
. Click *Save*.

== Change the Process Owner of an Automation Project

Change the owner of a process to represent changed responsibilities:

. Open the *Project Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click on the name of the category of the project.
. In the *<category name>* view, click *New Process Owner* (image:newprocessowner-icon.png[user-with-crown symbol,1.5%,1.5%]) on the panel of the project for which you want to change the process owner.
. In the window *New process owner*, select a user.
. Click *OK*

The new process owner is added to the process team with read access.

The previous process owner is removed from the process team independent of their previous authorizations. You can add them again as a team member.

== Change the Project Manager of an Automation Project

Change the manager of a project to represent changed responsibilities:

. Open the *Project Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click on the name of the category of the project.
. In the *<category name>* view, click *New Project Manager* (image:newprojectmanager-icon.png[user-with-tie symbol,1.5%,1.5%]) on the panel of the project for which you want to change the project manager.
. In the window *New project manager*, select a user.
+ 
You can only select a user who has the privilege *Project Management*.
. If you do not want to include the previous manager into the project team, unselect the checkbox *Add the current Project Manager to the project team. The current Project Manager is added with no assigned phases and thus only able to see this project.*
. Click *OK*

You can assign additional permissions to the previous manager as a team member.

== Remove an Automation Project

Remove automation projects you no longer need. This cannot be undone and is neither logged nor reported.

The *Delete* icon is only displayed if the logged-in user is the project's manager and the process has never been used productively. If the project has been transferred at least once to the production phase and deployed to an RPA Bot for processing, it can no longer be deleted.

To remove a project:

. Open the *Project Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click on the name of the category of the project.
. In the *<category name>* view, click *Remove* (image:delete-icon.png[trash symbol,1.5%,1.5%]) on the panel of the project to remove.
. Confirm the prompt.

== Manage Process Project Tasks

You can manage all tasks that arise in association with automating a process via an agile process board if you have <<projectdata-useprocessboard, enabled it for the project>>.

A task consists of a name, description, owner, priority, due date, and effort estimate. You can drag tasks across the board to reflect their progress.

A process board is a table with three columns, across which you can arrange task items:

* *To-do*
+
The *To-do* column contains all the tasks that have not been processed yet. You create new tasks here. If you have <<projectdata-phasereleasetasks, enabled the creation of automatically generated tasks for phase transitions>>, RPA Manager creates a new corresponding task during each phase transition. Remember to move tasks that are being processed into the *In Progress* area.
* *In Progress*
+
The *In Progress* column contains all the tasks that someone is currently working on. Remember to move tasks that have been completed into the *Completed* area.
* *Completed*
+
The *Completed* column contains all tasks that have already been completed. You can edit and move completed tasks. If you enabled the creation of automatically generated tasks for the phase transitions, the button for the transition to the next phase is disabled until this task has been moved to the *Completed* column.

Each userâ€™s process tasks are also displayed in the *My Process Board* view of the *My RPA* module.

Whether a process board should be created for a process is usually decided by the project manager directly during project creation. You can also decide to introduce a process board for any process later.

[[openprocessboard]]
=== Open a Process Board

To open a process board:

. Open the *Project Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click on the name of the category of the project.
. In the *<category name>* view, click *Open process board* (image:processboard-icon.png[column symbol,1.5%,1.5%]) on the project panel or in an already opened project.

Click *Back to Process* to return to or open the project.

[[form-createprocessboardtask]]
=== Create a Task

Create a process project task to enhance the automation.

Examples of such tasks could be `Design: Leaning (Remove superfluous elements from the graph, check for dead ends and double doors)`, `Add missing process documentation (Prepare decision table)` or `Kick-off Meeting`.

To create a task:

. <<openprocessboard, Open a process board>>.
. Click *+ Create Task* in the *To-do* column.
. Complete the form *Create new task*:
* *Task Owner*:
+
The task owner is responsible for completing the task. Choose a user from the process team. The task item displays the user's profile picture. RPA Manager shows all tasks of the task owners on their personal *My Process Board* view in the *My RPA* module.
* *Priority*:
+
You can set the priority of the task to low, medium, or high. The task item displays a gray, yellow, or red label, respectively.
* *Due date*:
+
Date on which the task should be completed.
* *Effort*:
+
Approximate amount of time that the task takes.
. Click Save.

=== Edit a Task

Edit tasks to reflect changed requirements:
