= Managing Automations

When a project manager clicks the icon *Start automation* for a process in the *My Backlog* view of the *My RPA* module, RPA Manager creates a project for the automation of the process.

To automate a process already evaluated with a third-party tool, a project manager can create an automation project inside a category directly in the *Process Automation* module.

The *Process Management* view shows the projects organized by category.

Within a category, you can manage the process automation projects:

* Create, copy, edit, and delete projects.
* View the status of projects, including financial analysis.
* Transition projects forward and backward through all life-cycle phases.
* Create boards for managing project tasks.

== Before You Begin

* Ask an administrator to xref:usermanagement-manage.adoc#assign-privileges-to-a-user[assign you the needed privileges]:

* To create or copy a project, you must be xref:usermanagement-manage.adoc#designate-a-user-as-project-manager[designated as project manager].
* To transition a project to another phase, you must have the needed permissions as a member of the <<projectdata-processteam, process team>>.

== Create an Automation project

When a project manager clicks the icon *Start automation* for a process in the *My Backlog* view of the *My RPA* module, RPA Manager creates a project for the automation of the process.

To automate a process already evaluated with a third-party tool, you can create an automation project inside a category directly in the *Process Automation* module:

. Open the *Project Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click on the name of the category in which you want to create the new project.
. In the *<category name>* view, click *Create*.
. [[form-createprocess]] Complete the form *Create process*:
+
include::rpa-manager::partial$form-automationproject.adoc[]
. Click *Save*.

RPA Manager returns to the *<category name>* view. Your new project is sorted into the view according to your workspace settings.

== Copy an Automation project

A copy of an automation project contains all information from the original project including the most recent revision of all workflows with the exception of the bot assignments to test and productive configurations.

Copy a project to automate a similar process faster:

. Open the *Project Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click on the name of the category in which you want to create the new project.
. In the *<category name>* view, click the *Copy* icon image:copy-icon.png[copy symbol,1.5%,1.5%] on the panel of the project you want to copy.
. Check and edit the form *Copy process*:
+
For an explanation of the properties, see <<form-createprocess, *Create process*>>.
. Click *Save*.

To complete copying of the project, first transfer the project to the *Build* phase. Then open it in the xref:rpa-builder::index.adoc[RPA Builder]. The project then receives its own identification values. The copied project can only transition to the *Test* phase after it has been uploaded from the RPA Builder to the RPA Manager.

== Edit an Automation Project

Edit an automation project to update it:

. Open the *Project Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click on the name of the category of the project.
. In the *<category name>* view, click the *Edit* icon image:edit-icon.png[pen-to-square symbol,1.5%,1.5%] on the panel of the project you want to edit.
. Check and edit the form *Copy process*:
+
For an explanation of the properties, see <<form-createprocess, *Create process*>>.
. Click *Save*.

== Change the Process Owner of an Automation Project

Change the owner of a process to represent changed responsibilities:

. Open the *Project Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click on the name of the category of the project.
. In the *<category name>* view, click the *New Process Owner* icon image:newprocessowner-icon.png[user-with-crown symbol,1.5%,1.5%] on the panel of the project for which you want to change the process owner.
. In the window *New process owner*, select a user.
. Click *OK*

The new process owner is added to the process team with read access.

The previous process owner is removed from the process team independent of their previous authorizations. You can add them again as a team member.

== Change the Project Manager of an Automation Project

Change the manager of a project to represent changed responsibilities:

. Open the *Project Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click on the name of the category of the project.
. In the *<category name>* view, click the *New Project Manager* icon image:newprojectmanager-icon.png[user-with-tie symbol,1.5%,1.5%] on the panel of the project for which you want to change the project manager.
. In the window *New project manager*, select a user.
. If you do not want to include the previous manager into the project team, unselect the checkbox *Add the current Project Manager to the project team. The current Project Manager will be added with no assigned phases and thus only able to see this project.*
. Click *OK*

You can assign additional permissions to the previous manager as a team member.

== Remove an Automation Project

Remove automation projects you no longer need. This cannot be undone and is neither logged nor reported.

The *Delete* icon is only displayed if the logged-in user is the project's manager and the process has never been used productively. If the project has been transferred at least once to the production phase and deployed to an RPA Bot for processing, it can no longer be deleted.

To remove a project:

. Open the *Project Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click on the name of the category of the project.
. In the *<category name>* view, click the *Remove* icon image:delete-icon.png[trash symbol,1.5%,1.5%] on the panel of the project you want to remove.
. Confirm the prompt.

== Manage Process Project Tasks

You can manage all tasks that arise in association with automating a process via an agile process board.

A process board is a table with three columns:

* *To-do*
+
The *To-do* column contains all the tasks that have not been processed yet. You create new tasks here. If you have enabled the creation of automatically generated tasks for phase transitions, RPA Manager creates a new corresponding task during each phase transition. Remember to move tasks that are being processed into the *In progress* area.
* *In progress*
+
The *In progress* column contains all the tasks that someone is currently working on. Remember to move tasks that have been completed into the *Completed* area.
* *Completed*
+
The *Completed* column contains all the tasks that have already been completed. You can edit and move completed tasks, too. If you have enabled the creation of automatically generated tasks for the phase transitions, the button for the transition to the next phase is not released until this task has been moved to the *Completed* column.

A task consists of a name, a description, an owner, a priority, a due date, and an effort estimate. You can drag tasks across the board to reflect their progress. Automatically created tasks for phase transitions must be moved to the *Completed* column to enable the transition of the project to the next phase.

Each userâ€™s process tasks are also displayed in the *My RPA* module, in the *My Process Board* view.

Whether a Process Board should be created for a Process is usually decided by the Project Manager directly during project creation. You can also decide to introduce a Process Board for any Process later.

To open a process board:

. Open the *Project Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click on the name of the category of the project.
. In the *<category name>* view, click the *Open process board* icon image:processboard-icon.png[column symbol,1.5%,1.5%] on the project panel to open the process board.

== Analyze the Financial Aspects of a Process

Open the xref:processoperations-financeanalysis.adoc[*Finance Analysis* view] to record, monitor, and analyze the financial aspects of a process:

. Open the *Project Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click on the name of the category of the project.
. In the *<category name>* view, click the *Finance Analysis* icon image:financeanalysis-icon.png[ symbol,1.5%,1.5%] the panel of the project you want to analyze.

== Transition an Automation Project to Another Phase

Once it's ready, transition the project to the next phase of its life-cycle. You can always transition back to change the project's design or implementation.

=== Transition to the Next Phase

. Open the *Project Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click on the name of the category of the project.
. In the *<category name>* view, click the name of a project.
. If the project uses a process board with automatic phase release tasks, complete that task to enable the transition.
. In the header, click *Publish <phase name>*.

=== Transition to a Previous Phase

. Open the *Project Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click on the name of the category of the project.
. In the *<category name>* view, click the name of a project.
. In the header, click *Back <phase name>*.
. Repeat the previous step until you reach the desired phase.
