= Process Monitoring

The *Process Monitoring* module displays the execution of your processes in real time.

In the *Bot State and Operation* view, you see the current status, the current deployment, and the number of completed tasks of each Bot.

In the *Process Streaming* view, you see the number of configurations, RPA Bots, and sessions for each productive process. You can open a live view of the sessions of a process and watch the bot as it works.

In the *Session Queues* view, you see the order of the process runs. The processes are queued according to their priority.
