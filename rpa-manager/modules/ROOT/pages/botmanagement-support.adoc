= Supporting Bots

A bot needs to know who it belongs to. You create API keys which the bots use to connect to RPA Manager.
If a bot only needs to work at specific times, you assign it service times.

== Manage API Keys

An API key is required during installation of a bot. The bot connects to the RPA Manager with its API key.

=== Create an API Key

Create a new API key for each bot before installation.

. In the *API Key* view of the *Bot Management* module, click *Create*.
. In the window *Create Bot API Key*, enter a name and description and click *OK*.

=== Edit an API Key

Edit an API key to change its name or description.

. In the *API Key* view of the *Bot Management* module, click the *Edit* icon image:edit-icon.png[pen-to-square symbol,1.5%,1.5%] in the table row of the API key you want to edit.
. In the window *Edit Bot API Key*, change name or description and click *OK*.

=== Remove an API Key

Remove API keys you no longer need.

When you delete an API key, the system does not check whether the key is assigned to a bot. If you have deleted an API key that is in use, the bot can no longer connect to RPA Manager until a new API key is assigned.

. In the *API Key* view of the *Bot Management* module, click the *Remove* icon image:delete-icon.png[trash symbol,1.5%,1.5%] in the table row of the API key you want to remove.
. Confirm the removal.

=== Copy an API Key to the Clipboard

Copy an API key to the clipboard to paste it into the according field during installation or configuration of a bot.

. In the *API Key* view of the *Bot Management* module, click the *Copy* icon image:copy-to-clipboard-icon.png[sheet-on-clipboard symbol,1.5%,1.5%] in the column *API Key* in the table row of the API key you want to copy to the clipboard.

== Manage Service Times

Service times are repeatable time intervals that define when a service is available. Assign them to bots to determine when a bot can execute processes.

You can use a service time to simulate the regular weekly working hours at your company, for example. The bot can then work at the same time as its human colleagues if tasks are interdependent, or at different times if you want it to use resources that other employees are not currently using.

Bots execute processes deployed to them only if they are within one of their service times.

You can assign multiple service times to a bot. If you do not assign service times to a bot, it works 24/7.

Specify the service time in one time zone. If the bot that you assign the service time to is installed on a computer that uses a different time zone, the service time interval is converted to the bot’s time zone. If you assign the service time to multiple bots in different time zones, all bots execute processes simultaneously. The time intervals might change, depending on daylight saving time.

For example, if you specify a service time that starts at 9:30 AM and ends at 5:30 PM in Buenos Aires time (ART (UTC -3)) and the bot is installed on a computer in Berlin (CET (UTC +1)), the bot executes processes between 1:30 PM and 9:30 PM in Berlin time.

You can create, edit, and remove service times.

Learn how to xref:botmanagement-manage.adoc#bot-assign-servicetimes-applications[assign service times to a bot].

== Create a Service Time

Create service times to coordinate bot working hours.

The names of the service times do not have to be unique. To avoid misinterpreting the effective schedule runtimes, include the time zone in the name of the service time.

For example, name your service time `Regular working hours - 9 AM - 5 PM - Mystical University - Buenos Aires (ART (UTC -3))` or  `Low resource usage time - 5 PM - 9AM - Mystical University - Berlin (CET (UTC +1))`.

. In the *Service Times* view of the *Bot Management* module, click *Create*.
. In the window *Create Service Time*, complete the form:
+
* *Timezone*: Specify a downtime in the time zone in which it occurs. If the bot that you assign the downtime to is installed on a computer that uses a different time zone, the downtime interval is converted to the bot’s time zone. If you assign the application to multiple bots in different time zones, all bots pause executing processes that use that application simultaneously. The time intervals might change, depending on daylight saving time.
+
For example, if you specify a service time starting at 9:30 AM and ending at 5:30 PM in Buenos Aires time (ART (UTC -3)) and the bot is installed on a computer in Berlin (CET (UTC +1)), the bot executes processes between 1:30 PM and 9:30 PM in Berlin time.

== Edit a Service Time

Edit a service time if it has changed.
If a changed service time is already used by a bot, it is updated automatically there.

. In the *Service Times* view of the *Bot Management* module, click the *Edit* icon image:edit-icon.png[pen-to-square symbol,1.5%,1.5%] in the table row of the service time you want to edit.
. In the window *Edit Service Time*, change the data and click *OK*.

== Remove a Service Time

Remove service times no longer effective.

The deleted service time is also removed from the service times of a bot. If the deleted service time is the only one that was used by a bot, the bot uses the default service time (24/7).

. In the *Service Times* view of the *Bot Management* module, click the *Remove* icon image:delete-icon.png[trash symbol,1.5%,1.5%] in the table row of the service time  you want to remove.
. Confirm the removal.
