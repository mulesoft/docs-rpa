= Supporting Bots

A bot needs to know who it belongs to. You create API keys which the bots use to connect to RPA Manager.
If a bot only needs to work at specific times, you assign it service times.

== Manage API Keys

An API key is required during installation of a bot. The bot connects to the server with its API key.

=== Create an API Key

Create a new API key for each bot before installation.

. In the *API Key* view of the *Bot Management* module, click *Create*.
. In the window *Create Bot API Key*, enter a name and description and click *OK*.

=== Edit an API Key

Edit an API key to change its name or description.

. In the *API Key* view of the *Bot Management* module, click the *Edit* icon image:edit-icon.png[pen-to-square symbol,1.5%,1.5%] in the table row of the API key you want to edit.
. In the window *Edit Bot API Key*, change name or description and click *OK*.

=== Remove an API Key

Remove API keys you no longer need.

When you delete an API key, the system does not check whether the key is assigned to a bot. If you have deleted an API key that is in use, the bot can no longer connect to RPA Manager until a new API key is assigned.

. In the *API Key* view of the *Bot Management* module, click the *Remove* icon image:delete-icon.png[trash symbol,1.5%,1.5%] in the table row of the API key you want to remove.
. Confirm the removal.

=== Copy an API key to the clipboard

Copy an API key to the clipboard to paste it into the according field during installation or configuration of a bot.

. In the *API Key* view of the *Bot Management* module, click the *Copy* icon image:copy-to-clipboard-icon.png[sheet-on-clipboard symbol,1.5%,1.5%] in the column *API Key* in the table row of the API key you want to copy to the clipboard.

== Manage Service Times

Service times are any repeatable time intervals that define when a service is available. You assign them to bots to determine when a bot may execute processes.

You can use a service time to simulate the regular weekly working hours at your company, for example. The bot can then work at the same time as its human colleagues if tasks are interdependent, or at different times if you want it to use resources that other employees are not currently using.

Processes that are deployed to the bot are only executed by the bot if it is within one of its service times.

You can assign multiple service times to a bot. If you do not assign any service times to a bot, it may work 24/7.

A service time is specified in a specific time zone. If the bot is in a different time zone, the time interval is converted accordingly.

You can create, edit, and remove service times.

== Create a Service Time

Create service times to coordinate bot working hours.

The names of the service times do not have to be unique. For example, you can assign the same name to a service time on working days for the business hours for different time zones. However, we recommend using different names, or at least different extensions to the same name, to rule out misunderstandings during interpretation of the effective schedule runtimes.

. In the *Service Times* view of the *Bot Management* module, click *Create*.
. In the window *Create Service Time*, complete the form:
// This section should be a partial to be reused in Process Automation - Configuration - Schedule
* *From*:
+
Start of the time interval. As of this time, the scheduled action is executed.
The start time must not be in the past and it must not be later than the end time.
Even if you specify a Repeat on a specific day of the week or month that does not correspond to the start time, the schedule is started at this time anyway. The day specified under Repeat is then taken into account from the first repetition onward.
* *To*:
+
End of the time interval. As of this time, the scheduled action is no longer executed.
The end time must not be earlier than the start time.
If you use the Repeat option, the duration of the time interval is defined by the difference between the From and To times.
* *All day*:
+
Select the checkbox *All day* to execute the action throughout the day.
It then begins on the first day at 12:00 midnight and stops being executed at 12:00 midnight of the next day (in the case of one-day intervals) or at 12:00 midnight on the day after the last day (in the case of multi-day intervals).
* *Repeat*:
+
Select the checkbox *Repeat* if the selected time interval is to be used repeatedly.
+
Then, under *Repeats*, you can choose whether the *From-To* time interval is to be repeated every minute, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly.
+
The duration of the contained time interval and the start time are taken into account. The duration of the time interval is defined as the difference between the *From* and *To* times. The *From* time is the start time of the first execution. The start time of repetitions depends on the other set values.
+
If you wish to execute the repeats only with reference to the time of day, you should ensure that the start and end date are identical. If the interval specified  covers multiple days, a new multi-day interval begins with every repetition. This can lead to a situation whereby the scheduled time interval lasts longer than expected because the full number of days contained in the *From-To* interval is executed once again during the last repetition.
+
With schedules that are not all day, the actions in each repetition are executed for the duration of the interval specified in *From* and *To*.

** *Repeat minutely*:
+
If you select *Repeat minutely*, the planned action is executed every minute during the interval specified above.
+
You can select whether you want to repeat the action every minute or only every _n_-th minute. _n_ here stands for any integer number between 1 and 59.
** *Repeat hourly*:
+
If you select *Repeat hourly*, the planned action is executed hourly during the interval specified above.You can select whether you want to repeat the action every hour or only every _n_-th hour. _n_ here stands for any integer number between 1 and 23.
** *Repeat daily*:
+
If you select *Repeat daily*, the planned action is executed daily during the interval specified above.
+
You can select whether you want to repeat the action every day or only every _n_-th day. _n_ here stands for any integer number between 1 and 31.
** *Repeat weekly*:
+
If you select Repeat weekly, the planned action is executed weekly during the interval specified above.
+
You can select whether you want to repeat the action every week or only every _n_-th week. _n_ here stands for any integer number between 1 and 52.
+
You can also select the weekday on which the scheduled action is to be executed.
** *Repeat monthly*:
+
If you select Repeat monthly, the planned action is executed monthly during the interval specified above.
+
You can select whether you want to repeat the action every month or only every _n_-th month. _n_ here stands for any integer number between 1 and 12.
+
You can also choose whether the repeat refers to the day of the month or the day of the week.
+
If the selected day is the last day of a month, you can also choose whether the execution day is always the last day of a month, as the number of days in each month is different.
+
If the selected day is the fourth such weekday of a month, you can also choose whether the execution day is always the fourth or last such weekday of a month, as the number of weeks in each month is different.
** *Repeat yearly*:
+
If you select *Repeat yearly*, the planned action is executed annually during the interval specified above.
+
You can select whether you want to repeat the action every year or only every _n_-th year. _n_ here stands for any integer number between 1 and 20.
* *Ends*:
+
If you select *Never* under Ends, the time period is repeated over and over.
+
If you select *After n occurrences* under *Ends*, the time period is repeated _n_ times. _n_ here stands for any integer number between 1 and 100.
+
If you select *Ends on <date>*, the time interval is no longer repeated after this date.

== Edit a Service Time

Edit a service time if it has changed.
If a changed service time is already used by a bot, it is updated automatically there.

. In the *Service Times* view of the *Bot Management* module, click the *Edit* icon image:edit-icon.png[pen-to-square symbol,1.5%,1.5%] in the table row of the service time you want to edit.
. In the window *Edit Service Time*, change the data and click *OK*.

== Remove a Service Time

Remove service times no longer effective.

The deleted service time is also removed from the service times of a bot. If the deleted service time is the only one that was used by a bot, the bot uses the default service time (24/7).

. In the *Service Times* view of the *Bot Management* module, click the *Remove* icon image:delete-icon.png[trash symbol,1.5%,1.5%] in the table row of the service time  you want to remove.
. Confirm the removal.
