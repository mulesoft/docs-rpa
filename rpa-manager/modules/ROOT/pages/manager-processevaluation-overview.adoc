= Process Evaluation

A process evaluation comprises the benefits and feasibility of the automation of a real-life business process. It includes details on a process's costs, duration, and frequency.

To propose a process candidate for automation, you evaluate the candidate based on pre-configured criteria.

As a project manager or a member of a center of excellence, you approve process candidates eligible for automation.

== Getting Started

==== Think
* What processes does your company use?
* Who is responsible for the processes?
* Which criteria are necessary and suitable for evaluating the processes?
* How can these criteria be described clearly and comprehensively?
* Where does the data for evaluating the processes come from?
* Which systems and data are needed for automating the processes?

==== Prepare
* In the *User Management* module, give your users the privileges and properties they need.
* After making the necessary systems available, define the applications, credentials, and global variables needed to automate the processes in the *Process Automation* module.

==== Configure
. In the *Evaluation Criteria* view, create the additional criteria needed to evaluate your processes.
. In the *Evaluation Templates* view, compile the criteria needed to evaluate certain process types.

==== Evaluate
* In the *Process Evaluation* view, create an evaluation based on a template for each of your processes.

==== Automate
* Select the processes to automate and delegate the implementation to a project manager or a center of excellence.

==== Administer
* Manage the automation projects in the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.

== Definitions

==== Process candidate

A _process candidate_ is a real-life business process to propose for automation via a process evaluation.

==== Center of excellence

If the users of a user group cover the entire range of competencies that are required for a specific part of the automation, the group is called a _center of excellence (CoE)_. Only user groups that are explicitly designated as centers of excellence can accept process automation tasks.
