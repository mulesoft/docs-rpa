= My RPA Overview

In your personal module *My RPA*, you see an overview of your processes and your currently pending tasks. You can view process details, start automations and complete tasks.

As a member of a center of excellence, in the *Team Backlog* view, you can assume responsibility for a previously evaluated process. As a project manager, you can start the automation of processes in the *My Backlog* view.

The *My Processes* view lists all processes for which you belong to the process team.

In the *My Process Board* view, you see your administrative process tasks.

To view user tasks, which are to be processed by you or your center of excellence in ongoing productive processes, call up the *Team Tasks* view. User tasks, which you wish to process, are moved to your personal list *My User Tasks*.
