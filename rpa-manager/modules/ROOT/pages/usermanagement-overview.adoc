= User Management Overview

In the *User Management* module, you can manage the users of the RPA Manager and of the RPA Builder.

A user contains contact details such as name, time zone and e-mail address. The user has privileges that enable access to specific modules and their contents, and can be authorized to edit a process project in various phases. A user can have a license for the RPA Builder. A user can be marked as project manager or process owner to assume responsibility for a process.

You can also assign roles to a user that contain all the needed privileges. Some important roles are already preconfigured. But you can also define your own roles.
