= User Management Overview
:page-notice-banner-message: MuleSoft RPA is integrating with Anypoint Platform to unify the login experience and provide support for external identity providers (IdP). After your organization is migrated to Anypoint Platform, the User Management module is removed.

In the *User Management* module, you manage the users of RPA Manager and RPA Builder:

* Create and delete users.
* Edit a user's personal data.
* Assign privileges or roles to a user that enable a user to work in specific modules.
* Create roles to combine privileges.
* License users for RPA Builder access.
* Mark a user as project manager.
* Assemble teams for task sharing.
* Mark teams as centers of excellence.
* Create user API keys to configure an API connector in MuleSoft Composer.
