The **Automation Management** widget shows the progress of your process automation based on the distribution of the projects to the different [Phases of the lifecycle of a project](../../ProcessAutomation/ProcessManagement/rpa_processAutomation_ProcessManagement_Category_Project_Details_Overview_EN.md#phasen-eines-projektes).

You can choose which [Project categories](../../ProcessAutomation/ProcessManagement/rpa_processAutomation_ProcessManagement_Categories_EN.md) are to be shown in the graphic. You can also include processes that are still being [evaluated](../../ProcessEvaluation/ProcessEvaluation/rpa_ProcessEvaluation_ProcessesOverview_EN.md).

In each case, the total number of selected processes for each phase is displayed.
