= Alerting Overview

RPA Manager can alert you in case of errors.

You define rules which RPA Manager checks during process run. If a rule applies, an email is sent to the targets you specify.

You can check for:

* Activity run results
* Process run results
* Bot status

The *Alerts* view shows you all triggered alerts.
