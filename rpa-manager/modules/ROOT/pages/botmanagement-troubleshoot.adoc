= Troubleshooting Bots

If a bot has status *OK*, but seems not to work properly, download its log files or restart the bot.

If the bot has status *SUSPENDED*, review the execution plans.

If a bot has status *STOPPED*, *OVERDUE*, or *UNKNOWN*, an IT administrator needs to log on to the computer the bot is installed on and needs to troubleshoot it there.

== View the Planned Process Executions

If you are not sure why a bot is not processing, review the execution plans:

. In the module *Bot Management*, open the view *Bot Execution Plans*.
. In the table, click the *Execution timetable* icon image:executiontimetable-icon.png["calendar symbol",1.5%,1.5%] in the row of the bot you want to check.

The execution timetable shows you the effective runtime of all configurations assigned to the bot.

. Click the *Configure Execution Timetable* icon image:configure-icon.png["wrench symbol",1.5%,1.5%] to change the time interval of the table and to select the shown configurations.
. Click *OK*.
. In the *Execution Timetable*, click a colored bar in the row of the configuration you want to check to view the composition of the effective runtime.

A configuration is executed when the bot's service time overlaps with the schedule of the configuration. If the process uses applications, it is not executed during the downtimes of an application.

All times are displayed in your local time. Times from bots and applications living in other time zones are converted to your local time. Hover over the bars to see which service times, downtimes, and schedules are contained in the execution times.

=== Example of the Effective Runtime Composition

image::rpa_botmanagement_botexecutionplans_example_effectiveschedulecomposition.png["Overview of how the effective runtime is composed from schedules, service times and downtimes"]

This example shows the planned process executions from the view of a user who lives in Rome (GMT+01:00). All shown times are converted to the user's time zone.

The production configuration uses a schedule that is repeated daily from 12:30 PM to 20:30 PM regardless of time zones.

The bot is installed on a computer that uses the UTC timezone. It has an assigned service time defined in Japanese time (GMT+09:00).

The process uses an application installed on a computer in Buenos Aires (GMT-03:00). There was a power outage during which the application was down from 10:00 AM until 10:30 AM.

When schedules and service times overlap and no used applications is down, the bot executes the process.

In this example, a downtime takes place in the middle of the scheduled time. The execution is interrupted during that time. Because the service time ends before the scheduled run time, the effective runtime is shortened.

As you can see in the *Schedule Chart*, the service times and the downtimes are converted to the bot's timezone. They are observed simultaneously across all time zones. The bots interpret the schedule to be valid for their own time zone. It is observed at different times across all time zones.

== View the Bot Log Messages

The bot log messages contain detailed information about a process run. RPA Manager lists each bot activity with information about the run result and displays bot messages contained in activities under *Additional Customer Info*.

To view the bot log messages:

. Open the *Process Run Statistics* view in the *Bot Management*.
+
Alternatively, in the *Process Automation* module:
+
** From within a project in the test or production phase, click on a run result number in the *Run Results* panel.
. Click the *Bot Message Log* icon image:botmessagelog-icon.png[list symbol,1.5%,1.5%] in the table row of the bot you want to read messages from.

Bot messages might be concatenated and truncated. To view the complete bot log, download the log files.

== Download the Log Files of a Bot

Download the zipped bot log files to check for error or warning messages or to view screenshots.

The package contains the folders `BotTrace` and `RpaBotLogfiles`. The trace folder contains the log files of the secure sessions, while the log files folder contains the installation and configuration data, as well as the execution log of the bot.

This option is only available when the bot has the status OK.

An IT administrator can configure the content of the package in the RPA Bot Configurator on the computer where the bot is installed.

. Open the *Bots* view of the *Bot Management* module.
. Click the *Download Logfiles* icon image:download-icon.png[disk-with-downwards-arrow symbol,1.5%,1.5%] in the row of the bot you want to read the log files from.
. Extract the contents and view the relevant files.

== Restart a Bot

Use this function to restart a bot to ensure that all the processes the bot is currently executing are completed properly before the bot is stopped.

Before a process is started, the bot has to check a variety of conditions. For example, whether it is within its assigned service time and whether all the applications that the process needs for execution are available.

The bot divides these tasks, which are independent from one another, into threads, which can run simultaneously (asynchronously). The bot then waits until all the tasks are complete and then either continues with starting the process or checks the conditions again.

In rare cases, an individual thread could have an error due to unforeseen circumstances, but cannot report it back to the bot. In this case, the Bot remains in wait status and cannot execute any more processes.

The latter might be the case when the bot has the status OK and a deployed process is within an effective runtime interval, but no process has been started for several minutes.

When you restart the bot, the bot and all of its threads are initially stopped after the pending tasks have been completed. The subsequent restart is then performed in a clean environment, which means the problem should no longer occur.

Restarting a bot only works if that bot has the status OK. Otherwise RPA Manager places the restart in the task list and executes it as soon as the bot is OK again.

. In the *Bots* view of the *Bot Management* module, click the *Restart* icon in the table row of the bot you want to restart.
. Wait a few seconds and refresh the browser to see the effect.
