= Troubleshooting Bots

If a bot has status *OK*, but seems not to work properly, download its log files or restart the bot.

If the bot has status *SUSPENDED*, have a look at the execution plans.

If a bot has status *STOPPED*, *OVERDUE*, or *UNKNOWN*, an IT administrator needs to log on to the computer the bot is installed on and needs to troubleshoot it there.

== View the planned process executions

If you are not sure why a bot is not processing, have a look at the execution plans:

. In the module *Bot Management*, open the view *Bot Execution Plans*.
. In the table click the *Execution timetable* icon image:executiontimetable-icon.png[calendar symbol,1.5%,1.5%] in the row of the bot you want to check.

The execution time table shows you the effective runtime of all configuration assigned to the bot.

. Click the *Configure Execution Timetable* icon image:configure-icon.png[wrench symbol,1.5%,1.5%] to change the time interval of the table and to select the shown configurations.
. Click *OK*.
. In the *Execution Timetable*, click on a colored bar in the row of the configuration you want to check to view the composition of the effective runtime.

A configuration is executed when the bot's servicetime overlaps with the schedule of the configuration. If the process uses applications, it is not executed during the downtimes of an application.

All times are displayed in your local time. Times from bots and applications living in other time zones are converted to your local time. Hover over the bars to see which service times, downtimes and schedules are contained in the execution times.

== Download the Log Files of a Bot

Download the zipped bot log files to check for error or warning messages or to view screenshots.

The package contains the folders `BotTrace` and `RpaBotLogfiles`. The trace folder contains the log files of the secure sessions, while the log files folder contains the installation and configuration data, as well as the execution log of the bot.

This option is only available when the bot has the status OK.

An IT administrator can configure the content of the package in the RPA Bot Configurator on the computer where the bot is installed.

. In the *Bots* view of the *Bot Management* module, click the *Download Logfiles* icon in the table row of the bot whose log files you want to read.
. Extract the contents and view the relevant files.

== Restart a Bot

Use this function to restart a bot to ensure that all the processes the bot is currently executing are completed properly before the bot is stopped.

Before a process is started, the bot has to check a variety of conditions. For example, whether it is within its assigned service time and whether all the applications that the process needs for execution are available.

The bot divides these tasks, which are independent from one another, into threads, which can run simultaneously (asynchronously). The bot then waits until all the tasks are complete and then either continues with starting the process or checks the conditions again.

In rare cases, an individual thread could have an error due to unforeseen circumstances, but cannot report it back to the bot. In this case, the Bot remains in wait status and cannot execute any more processes.

The latter might be the case when the bot has the status OK and a deployed process is within an effective runtime interval, but no process has been started for several minutes.

When you restart the bot, the bot and all of its threads are initially stopped after the pending tasks have been completed. The subsequent restart is then performed in a clean environment, which means the problem should no longer occur.

Restarting a bot will only work if that bot has the status OK. Otherwise it is placed in the task list and is executed as soon as the bot is OK again.

. In the *Bots* view of the *Bot Management* module, click the *Restart* icon in the table row of the bot you want to restart.
. Wait a few seconds and refresh the browser to see the effect.
