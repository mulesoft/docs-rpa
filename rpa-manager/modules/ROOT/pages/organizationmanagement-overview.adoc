:page-notice-banner-message: MuleSoft RPA is integrating with Anypoint Platform to unify the login experience and provide support for external identity providers (IdPs). After your organization migrates to Anypoint Platform, the Settings module replaces the Organization Management module.

The *Organization Management* module enables you to configure the currency and decimal sign to show in RPA Manager modules and configure your Anypoint Platform credentials, which enables you to publish a process automation to Anypoint Exchange.
