|===
|Action |RPA Permission |Deprecated RPA Permission

|Refer a process for automation to a center of excellence.
|RPA Evaluations Manager
|Process Evaluation Approval to a CoE

|Refer a process for automation directly to a project manager.
|RPA Evaluations Manager
|Process Evaluation Approval to a Project Manager

|===

* You can only approve evaluated process candidates.
* You can only refer processes to users assigned the `Project Management` privilege or user groups assigned as `Center of Excellence`. 
+
If you use an Anypoint account to login to RPA Manager, user groups are replaced by teams and the Center of Excellence flag is deprecated. Ensure that the team you refer a process to has the required RPA permissions for automating the process. 

== Select a Process for Approval

You can automate processes that have ratings for feasibility. Consider the benefits before automating a process. Automate simple processes first.

. Filter the process list in the *Process Evaluation* view of the *Process Evaluation* module to show only newly-created evaluations.
. View the *Process Matrix*. If you cannot see it, click *Expand* (image:expand-imagebutton.png[less-than symbol in a green half-circle,1.5%,1.5%]).
. Hover over the dots to see the names of the corresponding processes.
. Click one of the toggle-dots in the upper right half of the matrix to select it and to display only the corresponding processes.

== Approve a Process

Approve the selected process to refer it to a project manager or a center of excellence for automation.

After approval, the process is also displayed either in the personal backlog of the project manager (*My RPA* - *My Backlog*) or in the team backlog of the center of excellence (*My RPA* - *Team Backlog*).

. In the *Process Evaluation* view of the *Process Evaluation* module, click *Approve* in the row of the evaluation you want to approve.
. Choose a user or a center of excellence as *Project Manager*.
. Click *OK*.
