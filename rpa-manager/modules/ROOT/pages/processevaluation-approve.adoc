|*Action* |*Required Privileges*

|Approve an automation process for a center of excellence

|===

You can only approve evaluated process candidates.
You can only refer processes to users assigned as project manager or user groups assigned as center of excellence.

== Select a Process for Approval

You can automate processes that have ratings for feasibility. Consider the benefits before automating a process. Automate simple processes first.

. Filter the process list in the *Process Evaluation* view of the *Process Evaluation* module to show only newly-created evaluations.
. View the *Process Matrix*. If you cannot see it, click *Expand*: image:expand-imagebutton.png[less-than symbol in a green half-circle,1.5%,1.5%].
. Hover over the dots to see the names of the corresponding processes.
. Click one of the toggle-dots in the upper right half of the matrix to select it and to display only the corresponding processes.

== Approve a Process

Approve the selected process to refer it to a project manager or a center of excellence for automation.

After approval, the process is also displayed either in the personal backlog of the project manager (*My RPA* - *My Backlog*) or in the team backlog of the center of excellence (*My RPA* - *Team Backlog*).

. In the *Process Evaluation* view of the *Process Evaluation* module, click *Approve* in the table row of the evaluation you want to approve.
. Choose a user or a center of excellence as *Project Manager*.
. Click *OK*.
