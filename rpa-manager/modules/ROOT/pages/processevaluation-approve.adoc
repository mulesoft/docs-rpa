= Approving a Process for Automation
:page-notice-banner-message: MuleSoft RPA is integrating with Anypoint Platform to unify the login experience and provide support for external identity providers (IdPs). After your organization migrates to Anypoint Platform, user groups are replaced by teams and the Center of Excellence flag is deprecated. Ensure that the team you refer a process to has the required RPA permissions for automating the process. 

You approve an evaluated process candidate to refer it to a project manager or a center of excellence for automation.

== Before You Begin

* Ask an administrator to xref:usermanagement-manage.adoc#assign-privileges-to-a-user[assign you the required privileges]:
+
[cols="1,2"]
|===
|*Action* |*Required Privileges*

|Approve an automation process for a center of excellence
|Process Evaluation Approval to a CoE

|Approve directly for a project manager
|Process Evaluation Approval to a Project Manager

|===

* You can only approve evaluated process candidates.
* You can only refer processes to users assigned the `Project Management` privilege or user groups assigned as `Center of Excellence`. 

== Select a Process for Approval

You can automate processes that have ratings for feasibility. Consider the benefits before automating a process. Automate simple processes first.

. Filter the process list in the *Process Evaluation* view of the *Process Evaluation* module to show only newly-created evaluations.
. View the *Process Matrix*. If you cannot see it, click *Expand* (image:expand-imagebutton.png[less-than symbol in a green half-circle,1.5%,1.5%]).
. Hover over the dots to see the names of the corresponding processes.
. Click one of the toggle-dots in the upper right half of the matrix to select it and to display only the corresponding processes.

== Approve a Process

Approve the selected process to refer it to a project manager or a center of excellence for automation.

After approval, the process is also displayed either in the personal backlog of the project manager (*My RPA* - *My Backlog*) or in the team backlog of the center of excellence (*My RPA* - *Team Backlog*).

. In the *Process Evaluation* view of the *Process Evaluation* module, click *Approve* in the row of the evaluation you want to approve.
. Choose a user or a center of excellence as *Project Manager*.
. Click *OK*.
