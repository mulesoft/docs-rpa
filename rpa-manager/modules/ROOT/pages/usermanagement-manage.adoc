[[assign-privileges-to-a-user]]
== Assign Privileges to a User

A user needs privileges to view and use the RPA Manager modules. This ensures that only authorized users can access the modules. Assign privileges to a user when you create a new user or edit an existing user.

. In the *Users* view of the *User Management* module, click either *Create* in the header bar to create a new user or the icon *Edit* in the table row of the user you want to edit.
. In the form *<[Create,Edit]> a [New] User*, scroll down to the selection list *Available Privileges*.
. Click a privilege to assign it to the user.
. Repeat the previous step until the user has all needed privileges.
. Click *Save*.

== Change Process Assignments of a User

Instead of editing a project and adding a user to its project team, change several project assignments of a user at once:

. Open the *Users* view of the *User Management* module.
. Click the *Assign Project* icon image:assignproject-icon.png[process-diagram symbol,1.5%,1.5%] in the panel of the user whose project assignments you want to change.

The view *Assign Process* shows you a list of all processes where the user is part of the process team.

Change permissions for assigned projects to adapt to changed responsibilities:

. In the view *Assign Process*, for each process, select the checkboxes to permit the phases to the user.
. Click *Save*.

You cannot cannot change permissions for the project manager, who always has permissions for every phase.

The table does not show advanced permissions, which are sometimes needed to transfer a process to the next phase. To change these, xref:processautomation-manage.adoc#edit-an-automation-project[edit the process data sheet] in the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.

Assign additional processes to a user to support the process team:

. In the view *Assign Process*, select a process from the dropdown *Select Process*.
. In the table *Process List*, in the row of the added process, select the checkboxes of all phases the user needs to work in.
. Click *Save*.

Remove a user from a process team:

. In the view *Assign process*, click the the *Delete* icon image:delete-icon.png[trash symbol,1.5%,1.5%] for each process you want to remove from the user.
. Click *Save*.

The project manager and the project owner cannot be deleted. To change them, use the function xref:processautomation-manage.adoc#change-the-process-owner-of-an-automation-project[*New Process Owner*] or xref:processautomation-manage.adoc#change-the-project-manager-of-an-automation-project[*New Project Manager*] in the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.

== Reset a User Password

. In the *Users* view of the *User Management* module, click *Reset password* in the table row of the user you want to edit.

. Click on your user name in the navigation side bar.
. Click *Profile* in the drop-down menu.

[[iforgotmypassword]]
== Reset Your Password

If you forget your password or if your one-time password expires, click the link on the RPA Manager login page to reset it. You need to know your user name to reset your password.

. Navigate to the RPA Manager login screen.
. Click *Forgot your credentials?*.
. In the *Forgot your credentials* form, enter your username.
. Click *Continue*.

A confirmation request for creating a new password is emailed to you.

. Open the email in your email application.

A link to create a new password is emailed to you. The one-time password expires after 24 hours.
If you use two-factor authentication, append the time-based one-time password to your one-time password.

. Copy or remember the one-time password.
. Click *Sign In*.
. In the RPA Manager login screen, enter your user name and the one-time password.

== Enable Two-Factor Authentication for Your User

Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for extra security.

When using two-factor authentication, the user logs into the system with two mutually independent secret factors.

If 2FA is activated for a user of the RPA Manager, the user enters their personal password directly followed by a time-based one-time password (TOTP) on login to verify themselves.

The TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password Algorithm) is set up in a special app on a mobile device. Every thirty seconds, a new password is generated and this can be used for authentication within this time period.

Both the computer on which the RPA Manager is installed, and the mobile device on which the app for generation of the one-time password is installed, must be able to determine the precise Unix time for verification of the user. For this reason, the time on the devices used should be synchronized with UTC (Universal Time Coordinated).

. Click on your user name in the navigation side bar.
. Click *Profile* in the drop-down menu.
. In the *Profile* view, click *Enable Two-Factor Authentication*.
. Follow the instructions in the window *Enable Two-Factor Authentication*.
. Click *Enable Two-Factor Authentication*.
. Log in using your password and 2FA.
