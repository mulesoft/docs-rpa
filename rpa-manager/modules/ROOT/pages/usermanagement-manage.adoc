. Edit the form *Edit a User*.
. Click *Save*.

== Assign Privileges to a User

A user needs privileges to view and use the RPA Manager modules. This ensures that only authorized users can access the modules. Assign privileges to a user when you create a new user or edit an existing user.

. In the *Users* view of the *User Management* module, click either *Create* in the header bar to create a new user or the icon *Edit* in the table row of the user you want to edit.
. In the form *<[Create,Edit]> a [New] User*, scroll down to the selection list *Available Privileges*.
. Click a privilege to assign it to the user.
. Repeat the previous step until the user has all needed privileges.

=== Reset a User Password

Reset a password if the user forgot it. RPA Manager will send an email containing a new temporary password to the user. The user can then create a new password.

. In the *Users* view of the *User Management* module, click *Reset password* in the table row of the user you want to edit.

=== Change Your Password

Change your own password regularly. You will be logged out in the process and have to log in again. The password is used for login to RPA Manager and RPA Builder.

. Click on your user name in the navigation side bar.
. Click *Profile* in the drop-down menu.
. In the *Profile* view, click *Change password*.
. Enter your old and new password.
. Click *OK*.
. Log in with your new password.

=== Enable Two-Factor Authentication for Your User

Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for extra security.

When using Two-Factor Authentication, the user logs into the system with two mutually independent secret factors.

If 2FA is activated for a user of the RPA Manager, the user enters their personal password on login and also a time-based one-time password (TOTP) to verify themselves.

The TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password Algorithm) is set up in a special app on a mobile device. Every thirty seconds, a new password is generated and this can be used for authentication within this time period.

Both the computer on which the RPA Manager is installed, and the mobile device on which the app for generation of the one-time password is installed, must be able to determine the precise Unix time for verification of the user. For this reason, the time on the devices used should be synchronized with UTC (Universal Time Coordinated).

. Click on your user name in the navigation side bar.
. Click *Profile* in the drop-down menu.
. In the *Profile* view, click *Enable Two-Factor Authentication*.
. Follow the instructions in the window *Enable Two-Factor Authentication*.
. Click *Enable Two-Factor Authentication*.
. Log in using your password and 2FA.

== Remove a User

Remove obsolete users. A user cannot be deleted if it is the owner or manager of a process. Deleted users cannot be restored. Use the *Deactivate* function to remove a user only temporarily.

. In the *Users* view of the *User Management* module, click the icon *Remove* in the table row of the user you want to edit.
. Confirm the removal.

== Designate a User as Project Manager

. In the *Users* view of the *User Management* module, click the icon *Edit* in the table row of the user you want to designate as project manager.
. In the form *Edit a User*, check *Project Manager*.
. Click *Save*.

== Assign Users RPA Builder Access

Users who will build the process automation need RPA Builder access. Users currently working in RPA Builder might not be able to save their work if their license gets revoked.

. In the *Users* view of the *User Management* module, click *MuleSoft RPA Builder assignment*.
. Enable or disable access by clicking the appropriate cell in the column *MuleSoft RPA Builder access*.
