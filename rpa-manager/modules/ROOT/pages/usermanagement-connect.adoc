= Connecting to RPA Processes from Salesforce Products

RPA Manager requires user API keys to integrate RPA processes into other Salesforce products. For example, you can use your API key to configure an RPA connector in a MuleSoft Composer flow.

For security reasons, you can only see and copy your API key on creation.

== Create a User API Key

Create an API key for yourself to integrate an RPA process into another Salesforce product. After expiration, the integrated process instance can no longer connect to RPA Manager from other Salesforce products. Edit the API key to move the expiration date. For security reasons, RPA Manager shows the API Key only during creation. Copy your API Key and save it to a secure place. If you lose an API Key, create a new one.

To create a user API key: 

. Open the *User API Keys* view of the *User Management* module.
. Click *Create*.
. [[form-createuserapikey]] Complete the form *Create User API Key*:
* *User*:
+
Select yourself. Your identity and permissions are used to connect from another Salesforce products to RPA Manager.
* *Expiration Date*:
+
Select an expiration date for the user API key from the calendar.
. Click *OK*.
. In the window *Key Created!*, click *Copy to clipboard*.
. Copy the API key to a secure place.
. Click *Close*.

Copy your saved API key into the configuration settings of the Salesforce products into which you want to integrate the RPA processes.

== Edit a User API Key

Edit a user API key to change its name, description, or expiration date. If you lost access to your API key, create a new one.

To edit a user API key:

. Open the *User API Keys* view of the *User Management* module.
. Click the *Edit* icon image:edit-icon.png["pen-to-paper symbol",1.5%,1.5%] on the panel of the user API key to edit.

+
For an explanation of the properties, see <<form-createuserapikey, *Create a User API Key*>>.
. Click *Save*.

== Delete a User API Key

Delete a user API key to revoke the user's REST API access to RPA Manager. Integrated processes that use the deleted API key stop working.

To delete a user API key:

. Open the *User API Keys* view of the *User Management* module.
. Click the *Remove* icon image:delete-icon.png["trash can symbol",1.5%,1.5%] on the panel of the user API key to remove.
