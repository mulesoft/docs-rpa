= Bot Workload

The *Bot Workload* widget shows how many of the sessions of an *RPA Bot* are reserved and how many are still free.

This gives you an overview of the utilization of the bots and you can allocate resources flexibly.

== Data Representation

The workloads of the Bots are displayed as a bar chart.

The individual bars have different colors depending on the allocation between free sessions and those reserved for individual production configurations.

== Configuration

You can select multiple bots in sequence from the drop-down list.

== Drill-down

This widget does not contain any drill-down data.
