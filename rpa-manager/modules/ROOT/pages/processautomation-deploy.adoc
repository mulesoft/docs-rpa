= Deploying Automations

The third phase of process automation is the *Test* phase. In this phase, you can test the implemented process model in different configurations. You can transition back to *Build* phase to change the implementation.

When the tests are successful, transition to *Production* phase.

The final phase in the life-cycle of a process is the *Production* phase. This phase is structured similarly to the *Test* phase. The difference is that you do not have to start the individual process runs manually. Instead you schedule a process run configuration which is then executed automatically at defined times. Or you create an invokable run configuration and publish it to Anypoint Exchange.

* At least one RPA Bot must be installed to deploy a process.
** Be aware that bots can reside in different time zones.
* A project in test or production phase must exist in the *Project Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.
* Obtain the needed permissions as a member of the process team in the project data sheet in the *Project Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.

== Test a Process Automation

Transition the project to the test phase and create test configurations to execute test runs.

Test configurations contain start values for the activity parameters defined in RPA Builder, users who process the user tasks, the configuration of the test environment, and the executing bots.

Transition the project back to the build phase to change the implementation.

=== Transition Process to Test Phase

Transition the fully implemented process to test phase for testing:

. Open the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module and click on the name of the category of your project.
. Click on the name of a project to open it.
. Click *Publish (Test)*.
. In the window *Release to Test*, add the needed applications.
. Check *I confirm that the process should be released into the test phase and all responsible persons have agreed.*
. Click *Release to Test* to confirm the transition.

=== Create a Test Configuration

To create a test configuration:

. Open the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module and click on the name of the category of your project.
. Click on the name of a project to open it.
. Click *Create new test plan*.
. Complete the wizard *Create test plan*:
+
* *Activity Parameter*:
+
The activity parameters for each process are created in RPA Builder and are given initial values there. You can overwrite these values with new initial values by double-clicking on the relevant field in the *Value* column.
+
Set the value by entering text or by clicking on a checkbox, and complete your entries by pressing ENTER.
+

[[test-configuration-link-globals]]
Alternatively, you can set the values of the activity parameters by linking them with a global variable. To do this, click the *Link a global activity parameter* icon image:linkglobalvariable-icon.png[ symbol,1.5%,1.5%]. Only those variables assigned to the phase will be displayed for linking. The variables are typed. You can only enter or link values of the same type.  The values entered here are only start values and they can be overwritten by other values during the course of the process run.
* *User Task*:
+
User tasks are elements of a process model, which cannot be processed fully automatically by a bot, but which require the support of a human. Specify which users are to process the user tasks by clicking on the *User Assignment or  User Group Assignment* icon. The number of assigned users and user groups is displayed in the table. You can specify both users and user groups at the same time. The user task is then displayed to each specified user until a user reserves it for processing.
+
Select the checkbox *Send email notification to all related users* when the task is ready for processing if you want all specified users to receive an email as soon as they are supposed to process a user task. This email contains the name of the user task, the process, and the project manager, as well as a prompt to review the pending tasks in the *My RPA* module.
* *Execution*:
+
Decide whether the test run is to be carried out in an existing desktop session or in a secure session, and specify an appropriate user.
+
For implementation in a secure session, you can link the user with a global credential variable. To do this,  click on the *Link a global activity parameter* icon.
+
Use the syntax `domain\username` instead of `username@domain.com` for domain users and `username` for local users, regardless of whether you enter the username manually or link a global credential.
+
Make sure the bot you want to execute the process is configured for the execution type, because you cannot save the test plan otherwise.
+
If the process uses elements of the Windows operating system like the start menu or the task bar, check *Requires Windows Shell*.
* *Bots*:
+
Select all RPA Bots that are to carry out the test configuration.
+
Select the checkbox *Show bots not enabled in this phase* to also show bots that are not intended for use in this phase.
+
When you select a bot, ensure that it is configured for the required session type, that it is allowed to be deployed in the relevant phase, and that it can operate the required applications.
+
If one of the selected bots is not configured appropriately, a notification appears and you cannot proceed with the test plan configuration.

* *Execution*:
+
Decide whether the productive run is to be carried out in an existing desktop session or in a secure session, and specify an appropriate user.
+
For implementation in a secure session, you can link the user with a global credential variable. To do this,  click on the *Link a global activity parameter* icon.
+
Use the syntax `domain\username` instead of `username@domain.com` for domain users and `username` for local users, regardless of whether you enter the username manually or link a global credential.

If the process uses elements of the Windows operating system like the start menu or the task bar, check *Requires Windows Shell*.
//copy this item to invokable configs
* *Process Trigger Execution*:
+
The productive run is carried out continuously within a fixed schedule. For each schedule, you can define time intervals within which the process is executed.
+
You create a schedule without specifying a time zone. The bot you assign the production configuration to executes the process at the specified times in its local time. The time intervals might change, depending on daylight saving time.
+
For example, if you work in Buenos Aires (ART (UTC -3)), specify a schedule that starts at 5:30 AM and ends at 9:30 PM and assign the configuration to three bots installed on computers in Berlin, San Francisco, and Tokyo, the bots do not execute the processes simultaneously:
+
[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|*Bot* |*Execution time in the bot's local time zone* |*Execution time in the argentine user's local time zone*

|Berlin bot
|5:30 AM - 9:30 PM (Berlin time,  (CET (UTC +1)) =
|1:30 AM - 5:30 PM (Buenos Aires time (ART (UTC -3)))

|San Francisco bot
|5:30 AM - 9:30 PM (San Francisco time, (PST (UTC -8)) =
|10:30 AM - 2:30 AM (Buenos Aires time (ART (UTC -3)))

|Tokyo bot
|5:30 *AM* - 9:30 PM (Tokyo time, JST (UTC +9)) =
|5:30 *PM* - 9:30 AM (Buenos Aires time (ART (UTC -3)))

|===
+
You can create multiple schedules. These may also overlap. All schedules together make up a time frame within which the process may be executed. The executing bot checks every minute whether it is within this time frame or not. A new process run is not started until all conditions have been fulfilled.
+
For this reason, the executing bot checks every minute whether it is within a service time and whether the required process applications are outside all downtimes. The process is not executed if the executing bot is outside its service time or if one or more of the process applications used by the bot are within a downtime.
+
Running processes are always executed completely.
+
When creating new schedules, you should pay attention to whether the new schedules overlap with schedules of other configurations and you should ensure that the executing bots have enough free sessions. Otherwise, trigger executions could be skipped.
+
Click on the button *Add Schedule* to assign a (further) schedule to this configuration and complete the form *Create a new schedule*:
+
include::rpa-manager::partial$form-scheduling.adoc[]
* *Bots*:
+
Select all RPA Bots that are to carry out the production configuration.
+
Select the checkbox *Show bots not enabled in this phase* to also show bots that are not intended for use in this phase.
+
When you select a bot, ensure that it is configured for the required session type, that it is allowed to be deployed in the relevant phase, and that it can operate the required applications.
+
If one of the selected bots is not configured appropriately, a notification appears and you cannot proceed with the configuration .
