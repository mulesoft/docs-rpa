= Deploying Automations

The third phase of process automation is the *Test* phase. In this phase, you can test the implemented process model in different configurations. You can transition back to *Build* phase to change the implementation.

When the tests are successful, transition to *Production* phase.

The final phase in the life-cycle of a process is the *Production* phase. This phase is structured similarly to the *Test* phase, except that in the production phase, you don't have to start the individual process runs manually. Instead, you can do either of the following:
* Schedule a process run configuration that is executed automatically at defined times. 
* Create an invocable run configuration and publish it to Anypoint Exchange.

You can run processes openly in existing console sessions or run them hidden in Secure Sessions. In console sessions, only one process can run at a time. In Secure Sessions, different processes or several instances of the same process can run in parallel.

== Before You Begin

* Ask an organization administrator in Access Management to assign you the required permissions:
+
[%header, cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Action |RPA Permission |Deprecated RPA Permission

|Open the *Process Automation* module.
||RPA Automations Designer, RPA Automations Contributor, RPA Automations Manager, RPA Administrator
|Process Automation Open

|===

* At least one RPA Bot must be installed to deploy a process.
** Be aware that bots can reside in different time zones.
* If you want to use the values of xref:processautomation-prepare-deployment-variable.adoc[global variables] or xref:processautomation-prepare-deployment-credential.adoc[credentials] as initial values for activity parameters, an RPA administrator must create them in the *Global Variables* or *Credential Pool* view first.
* A project in test or production phase must exist in the *Project Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.
* Obtain the needed permissions as a member of the process team in the project data sheet in the *Project Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.
* To run a process in an existing console or RDP session, you must deploy it to a bot that is configured for console sessions, and the specified user must be logged in to this session when you deploy the run configuration. If the user is logged in more than once, the bot starts the process in the first session in which the user is logged in. The bot searches for the user in this order:
. Physical console session
. RDP session 1
. RDP session ...
. RDP session stem:[n].

+
[WARNING]
Bots running an earlier version than 1.2.0 overtake an open console session without checking if the logged-in user matches the specified user.

+
Don't close or minimize the console session while the bot executes the process.

* To run a process in a hidden session, you must deploy it to a bot configured for Secure Sessions. Before deploying a run configuration on a bot that has only one licensed secure session, don't disconnect the session, instead sign out the specified user. Don't sign in to a computer where a bot with one licensed Secure Session is running a process.
* RPA Manager requires authentication to integrate RPA processes into other Salesforce products:
** Use user API keys to use Salesforce Flows with RPA. 
** Use Connected Apps to configure an RPA connector in a MuleSoft Composer flow. 

== Test a Process Automation

Transition the project to the test phase and create test configurations to execute test runs.

Test configurations contain start values for the activity parameters defined in RPA Builder, users who process the user tasks, the configuration of the test environment, and the executing bots.

Transition the project back to the build phase to change the implementation.

=== Transition Process to Test Phase

Transition the fully implemented process to test phase for testing:

. Open the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module and click on the name of the category of your project.
. Click on the name of a project to open it.
. Click *Publish (Test)*.
. In the window *Release to Test*, add the needed applications.
. Check *I confirm that the process should be released into the test phase and all responsible persons have agreed.*
. Click *Release to Test* to confirm the transition.

=== Create a Test Configuration

To create a test configuration:

. Open the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module and click on the name of the category of your project.
. Click on the name of a project to open it.
. Click *Create new test plan*.
. Complete the *Create test plan* wizard:
+
* *Activity Parameter*
+
The activity parameters for each process are created in RPA Builder and are given initial values there. You can overwrite these values with new initial values by double-clicking on the relevant field in the *Value* column.
+
Set a value by entering text or by clicking on a checkbox, and complete your entry by pressing ENTER.
+
[[test-configuration-link-globals]]

Alternatively, you can set the value of an activity parameter by linking it with a global variable. To link the parameter to a variable, click *Link a global activity parameter* (image:linkglobalvariable-icon.png[symbol,1.5%,1.5%]) and select a variable. RPA Manager displays variables of the same type, assigned to the test phase, and only the credentials to which you are xref:processautomation-prepare-deployment-credential.adoc#form-create-credential-useraffiliation[affiliated]. If a credential affiliated to another user is already linked, RPA Manager displays a row of stars to hide the data. 
+
The variables are typed. You can only enter or link values of the same type. The values entered here are start values, which can be overwritten by other values during the process run.
* *User Task*
+
User tasks are elements of a process model, which can't be processed fully automatically by a bot, but which require the support of a human. Specify which users are to process the user tasks by clicking on the *User Assignment or  User Group Assignment* icon. The number of assigned users and user groups is displayed in the table. You can specify both users and user groups at the same time. The user task is then displayed to each specified user until a user reserves it for processing.
+
Select the checkbox *Send email notification to all related users* when the task is ready for processing if you want all specified users to receive an email as soon as they are supposed to process a user task. This email contains the name of the user task, the process, and the project manager, as well as a prompt to review the pending tasks in the *My RPA* module.
* *Execution*
+
Decide whether to carry out the test run in an existing console or RDP session or in a Secure Session, and specify an appropriate user.
+
You can link the user with a global credential variable by clicking on the *Link a credential from credential pool* icon.
+
Use the syntax `domain\username` instead of `username@domain.com` for domain users and `username` for local users, regardless of whether you enter the username manually or link a global credential.
+
Ensure that the bot that you want to execute the process is configured for the execution type, because you can't save the test configuration otherwise.
+
The bot can overtake the console or RDP session only if the specified user is logged in at runtime. If no user or another user is logged in at runtime, the process run results show the failure *No active session with the user '<user name>' could be found on the system*. 
+
[WARNING]
Bots running an earlier version than 1.2.0 overtake an open console session without checking if the logged-in user matches the specified user.
+
If you want to watch the execution of the process in the *Process Streaming* view of the *Process Monitoring* module or if the process uses elements of the Windows operating system like the start menu or the task bar, check *Enable Taskbar (Start menu, taskbar buttons)*.
* *Bots*
+
Select all RPA Bots that are to carry out the test configuration.
+
Select the checkbox *Show bots not enabled in this phase* to also show bots that aren't intended for use in this phase.
+
When you select a bot, ensure that it is configured for the required session type, that it is allowed to be deployed in the relevant phase, and that it can operate the required applications.
+
If one of the selected bots is not configured appropriately, RPA Manager displays a notification, and you can't proceed with the test configuration.
Hover the mouse pointer over the info label to display more detailed information about the cause of the warning or error in the form of a tooltip.
. Click *Finish*.

=== Run Tests

. View the run results in the table.
. If you want details on a result, click a number.
. In case of errors, click the *Download* icon.

== Deploy a Process Automation

Transition the project to the production phase to deploy a scheduled run configuration to a bot. The process runs fully automated from now on.

Pause or revoke configurations to stop the execution temporarily. Transition the project back to the build phase to change the implementation.

Projects that have already been used productively can no longer be deleted.

=== Transition Process to Production Phase

Transition the tested process to production phase for running it fully automatically or for publishing it to Anypoint Exchange:

. Open the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module and click on the name of the category of your project.
. Click on the name of a project to open it.
. Click *Publish (Production)*.
. In the window *Release to Production*, add the needed applications.

[[production-configuration]]
=== Create a Run Configuration

To create a run configuration:

. Open the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module and click on the name of the category of your project.
. Click on the name of a project to open it.
. Click *Create run configuration*.
. Complete the *Create production configuration* form:
+
* *Settings*
+
** *Priority*
+
Enter a number between 1 and 200 to specify the priority of the process run. Deployed processes are inserted in a session queue according to their priority. Process configurations with lower numbers are considered higher priority and are executed before configurations of lower priority.
* *Activity Parameter*
+
The activity parameters for each process are created in RPA Builder and are given initial values there. You can overwrite these values with new initial values by double-clicking on the relevant field in the *Value* column.
+
Set a value by entering text or by clicking on a checkbox, and complete your entry by pressing ENTER.
+
[[production-configuration-link-globals]]
Alternatively, you can set the value of an activity parameter by linking it with a global variable. To link the parameter to a variable, click *Link a global activity parameter* (image:linkglobalvariable-icon.png[link symbol,1.5%,1.5%]) and select a variable. RPA Manager displays variables of the same type, assigned to the production phase, and only the credentials to which you are xref:processautomation-prepare-deployment-credential.adoc#form-create-credential-useraffiliation[affiliated]. If a credential affiliated to another user is already linked, RPA Manager displays a row of stars to hide the data. 
+
The variables are typed. You can only enter or link values of the same type. The values entered here are start values, which can be overwritten by other values during the process run.
* *User Task*:
+
User tasks are elements of a process model, which can't be processed fully automatically by a bot, but which require the support of a human. Specify which users are to process the user tasks by clicking on the *User Assignment or  User Group Assignment* icon. The number of assigned users and user groups is displayed in the table. You can specify both users and user groups at the same time. The user task is then displayed to each specified user until a user reserves it for processing.
+
Select the checkbox *Send email notification to all related users* when the task is ready for processing if you want all specified users to receive an email as soon as they are supposed to process a user task. This email contains the name of the user task, the process, and the project manager, as well as a prompt to review the pending tasks in the *My RPA* module.
* *Execution*:
+
Decide whether to carry out the productive run in an existing console or RDP session or in a Secure Session, and specify an appropriate user.
+
You can link the user with a global credential variable by clicking on the *Link a credential from credential pool* icon.
+
Use the syntax `domain\username` instead of `username@domain.com` for domain users and `username` for local users, regardless of whether you enter the username manually or link a global credential.
+
Ensure that the bot that you want to execute the process is configured for the execution type, because you can't save the run configuration otherwise.
+
The bot can overtake the console or RDP session only if the specified user is logged in at runtime. If no user or another user is logged in at runtime, the process run results show the failure *No active session with the user '<user name>' could be found on the system*. 
+
[WARNING]
Bots running an earlier version than 1.2.0 overtake an open console session without checking if the logged-in user matches the specified user.
+
[[runconfig-execution-enabletaskbar]] If you want to watch the execution of the process in the *Process Streaming* view of the *Process Monitoring* module or if the process uses elements of the Windows operating system like the start menu or the task bar, check *Enable Taskbar (Start menu, taskbar buttons)*.
* *Process Trigger Execution*:
+
The productive run is carried out continuously within a fixed schedule. For each schedule, you can define time intervals within which the process is executed.
+
You create a schedule without specifying a time zone. The bot you assign the production configuration to executes the process at the specified times in its local time. The time intervals might change, depending on daylight saving time.
+
For example, if you work in Buenos Aires (ART (UTC -3)), specify a schedule that starts at 5:30 AM and ends at 9:30 PM and assign the configuration to three bots installed on computers in Berlin, San Francisco, and Tokyo, the bots don't execute the processes simultaneously:
+
[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|*Bot* |*Execution Time in the Bot's Local Time Zone* |*Execution Time in the Buenos Aires User's Local Time Zone*

|Berlin bot
|5:30 AM - 9:30 PM (Berlin time,  (CET (UTC +1)) =
|1:30 AM - 5:30 PM (Buenos Aires time (ART (UTC -3)))

|San Francisco bot
|5:30 AM - 9:30 PM (San Francisco time, (PST (UTC -8)) =
|10:30 AM - 2:30 AM (Buenos Aires time (ART (UTC -3)))

|Tokyo bot
|5:30 AM - 9:30 PM (Tokyo time, JST (UTC +9)) =
|5:30 PM - 9:30 AM (Buenos Aires time (ART (UTC -3)))

|===
+
You can create multiple schedules. These may also overlap. All schedules together make up a time frame within which the process may be executed. The executing bot checks every minute whether it is within this time frame or not. A new process run is not started until all conditions have been fulfilled.
+
For this reason, the executing bot checks every minute whether it is within a service time and whether the required process applications are outside all downtimes. The process is not executed if the executing bot is outside its service time or if one or more of the process applications used by the bot are within a downtime.
+
Running processes are always executed completely.
+
When creating new schedules, you should pay attention to whether the new schedules overlap with schedules of other configurations and you should ensure that the executing bots have enough free sessions. Otherwise, trigger executions could be skipped.
+
Click on the button *Add Schedule* to assign a (further) schedule to this configuration and complete the *Create a new schedule* form:
+
include::rpa-manager::partial$form-scheduling.adoc[]
* *Bots*:
+
Select all RPA Bots that are to carry out the production configuration.
+
Select the checkbox *Show bots not enabled in this phase* to also show bots that aren't intended for use in this phase.
+
When you select a bot, ensure that it is configured for the required session type, that it is allowed to be deployed in the relevant phase, and that it can operate the required applications.
+
If one of the selected bots is not configured appropriately, RPA Manager displays a notification, and you can't proceed with the configuration.
Hover the mouse pointer over the info label to display more detailed information about the cause of the warning or error in the form of a tooltip.
