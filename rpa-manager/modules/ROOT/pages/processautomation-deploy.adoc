= Deploying Automations

The third phase of process automation is the *Test* phase. In this phase, you can test the implemented process model in different configurations. You can xref:processautomation-manage.adoc#transition-an-automation-project-to-another-phase[transition] back to *Build* phase to change the implementation.

When the tests are successful, transition to *Production* phase.

The *Production* phase is the final phase in the life cycle of a process. 

You have three options how to run processes:

* Create and deploy a **Scheduled Run Configuration** to run the process automatically at defined times. 
* Create and publish an **Invocable Run Configuration** to use it within other Salesforce products.
* Create an **On-Demand Run Configuration** to start the process run manually.

You can't run processes openly in existing console sessions or run them hidden in Secure Sessions. In console sessions, only one process can run at a time. In Secure Sessions, different processes or several instances of the same process can run in parallel.

== Before You Begin

* Ask an organization administrator in Access Management to assign you the required permissions:
+
[%header, cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Action |RPA Permission |Deprecated RPA Permission

|Open the *Process Automation* module.
|RPA Automations Designer, RPA Automations Contributor, RPA Automations Manager, RPA Administrator
|Process Automation Open

|===

* At least one RPA Bot must be installed to deploy or publish a process.
** Be aware that bots can reside in different time zones.
* If you want to use the values of xref:processautomation-prepare-deployment-variable.adoc[global variables] or xref:processautomation-prepare-deployment-credential.adoc[credentials] as initial values for activity parameters, an RPA administrator must create them in the *Global Variables* or *Credential Pool* view first.
* A project in test or production phase must exist in the *Project Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.
* Obtain the needed permissions as a member of the process team in the project data sheet in the *Project Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.
* To run a process in an existing console or RDP session, you must deploy it to a bot that is configured for console sessions, and the specified user must be logged in to this session when you deploy the run configuration. If the user is logged in more than once, the bot starts the process in the first session in which the user is logged in. The bot searches for the user in this order:
. Physical console session
. RDP session 1
. RDP session ...
. RDP session stem:[n].

+
[WARNING]
Bots running an earlier version than 1.2.0 overtake an open console session without checking if the logged-in user matches the specified user.

+
Don't close or minimize the console session while the bot executes the process.

* To run a process in a hidden session, you must deploy it to a bot configured for Secure Sessions. Before deploying a run configuration on a bot that has only one licensed secure session, don't disconnect the session, instead sign out the specified user. Don't sign in to a computer where a bot with one licensed Secure Session is running a process.
* RPA Manager requires authentication to integrate RPA processes into other Salesforce products:
** Use user API keys to use Salesforce Flows with RPA. 
** Use Connected Apps to configure an RPA connector in a MuleSoft Composer flow. 

== Test a Process Automation

Transition the project to the test phase and create test configurations to execute test runs.

Test configurations contain start values for the activity parameters defined in RPA Builder, users who process the user tasks, the configuration of the test environment, and the executing bots.

Transition the project back to the build phase to change the implementation.

=== Transition Process to Test Phase

Transition the fully implemented process to test phase for testing:

. Open the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module and click on the name of the category of your project.
. Click on the name of a project to open it.
. Click *Publish (Test)*.
. In the window *Release to Test*, add the needed applications.
. Check *I confirm that the process should be released into the test phase and all responsible persons have agreed.*
. Click *Release to Test* to confirm the transition.

=== Create a Test Configuration

To create a test configuration:

. Open the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module and click on the name of the category of your project.
. Click on the name of a project to open it.
. Click *Create new test plan*.
. Complete the *Create test plan* wizard:
+
* *Activity Parameter*
+
The activity parameters for each process are created in RPA Builder and are given initial values there. You can overwrite these values with new initial values by double-clicking on the relevant field in the *Value* column.
+
Set a value by entering text or by clicking on a checkbox, and complete your entry by pressing ENTER.
+
[[test-configuration-link-globals]]

Alternatively, you can set the value of an activity parameter by linking it with a global variable. To link the parameter to a variable, click *Link a global activity parameter* (image:linkglobalvariable-icon.png[symbol,1.5%,1.5%]) and select a variable. RPA Manager displays variables of the same type, assigned to the test phase, and only the credentials to which you're xref:processautomation-prepare-deployment-credential.adoc#form-create-credential-useraffiliation[affiliated]. If a credential affiliated to another user is already linked, RPA Manager displays a row of stars to hide the data. 
+
The variables are typed. You can only enter or link values of the same type. The values entered here are start values, which can be overwritten by other values during the process run.
* *User Task*
+
User tasks are elements of a process model, which can't be processed fully automatically by a bot, but which require the support of a human. Specify which users are to process the user tasks by clicking on the *User Assignment or  User Group Assignment* icon. The number of assigned users and user groups is displayed in the table. You can specify both users and user groups at the same time. The user task is then displayed to each specified user until a user reserves it for processing.
+
Select the checkbox *Send email notification to all related users* when the task is ready for processing if you want all specified users to receive an email as soon as they're supposed to process a user task. This email contains the name of the user task, the process, and the project manager, as well as a prompt to review the pending tasks in the *My RPA* module.
* *Execution*
+
Decide whether to carry out the test run in an existing console or RDP session or in a Secure Session, and specify an appropriate user.
+
You can link the user with a global credential variable by clicking on the *Link a credential from credential pool* icon.
+
Use the syntax `domain\username` instead of `username@domain.com` for domain users and `username` for local users, regardless of whether you enter the username manually or link a global credential.
+
Ensure that the bot that you want to execute the process is configured for the execution type, because you can't save the test configuration otherwise.
+
The bot can overtake the console or RDP session only if the specified user is logged in at runtime. If no user or another user is logged in at runtime, the process run results show the failure *No active session with the user '<user name>' could be found on the system*. 
+
[WARNING]
Bots running an earlier version than 1.2.0 overtake an open console session without checking if the logged-in user matches the specified user.
+
If you want to watch the execution of the process in the *Process Streaming* view of the *Process Monitoring* module or if the process uses elements of the Windows operating system like the start menu or the task bar, check *Enable Taskbar (Start menu, taskbar buttons)*.
* *Bots*
+
Select all RPA Bots that are to carry out the test configuration.
+
Select the checkbox *Show bots not enabled in this phase* to also show bots that aren't intended for use in this phase.
+
When you select a bot, ensure that it's configured for the required session type, that it's allowed to be deployed in the relevant phase, and that it can operate the required applications.
+
If one of the selected bots isn't configured appropriately, RPA Manager displays a notification, and you can't proceed with the test configuration.
Hover the mouse pointer over the info label to display more detailed information about the cause of the warning or error in the form of a tooltip.
. Click *Finish*.

=== Run Tests

Run all tests in parallel. RPA Manager shows a warning in case of deployment problems.

View the results in the *Test Results* panel:

. Open the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module and click on the name of the category of your project.
. Click on the name of a project to open it.
. Click *Start tests*.
. In the window *Select Configuration to deploy*, check all test configurations you want to run.
. Click *Execute*.

=== View Test Results

View the test results to decide if the project can transition to production phase. In case of errors, download an analysis package and open it in RPA Builder.

To view the test results and to download an analysis package:

. Open the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module and click on the name of the category of your project.
. Click on the name of a project to open it.
. In the panel *Test Results*, select a time interval and click *Update*.
. View the run results in the table.
. If you want details on a result, click a number.
. In case of errors, click the *Download* icon.

== Deploy a Process Automation

Transition the project to the production phase to deploy a run configuration to a bot. The process runs fully automated from now on.

Sometimes it's necessary to start a process manually when something happens that can only a human can evaluate. For example, the goods inwards inspection process can only start after the banana delivery ship reaches the pier wall. For this purpose, use the *Run Now* option.

You have three options how to run processes:

* Create and deploy a **Scheduled Run Configuration** to run the process automatically at defined times. 
* Create and publish an **Invocable Run Configuration** to use it within other Salesforce products.
* Create an **On-Demand Run Configuration** to start the process run manually.

You can run processes openly in existing console sessions or run them hidden in Secure Sessions. In console sessions, only one process can run at a time. In Secure Sessions, different processes or several instances of the same process can run in parallel.

Pause or revoke configurations to stop the execution temporarily. Transition the project back to the build phase to change the implementation.

You can't delete projects of processes that a bot has already run productively.

=== Transition Process to Production Phase

Transition the tested process to production phase for running it fully automatically or for publishing it to Anypoint Exchange:

. Open the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module and click on the name of the category of your project.
. Click on the name of a project to open it.
. Click *Publish (Production)*.
. In the window *Release to Production*, add the needed applications.
. Check *I confirm that the process should be released into the production phase and all responsible persons have agreed.*
. Click *Release to Production* to confirm the transition.

[[production-configuration]]
=== Create a Run Configuration

A run configuration consists of a name, a description, initial values for the Activity Parameters, one or more bots and conditions for deployment of the automation with this configuration. 

There are three types of run configurations: 

* **Scheduled run configurations** define intervals for the runs.
* **Invocable run configurations** are called from other products. Automations can have one invocable run configuration.
* **On-demand run configurations** are started manually.

You can publish an invocable run configuration after you save it.

You can create a new configuration or <<copy-run-config, copy>> an existing one.

To create a new run configuration:

. Open the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module and click on the name of the category of your project.
. Click on the name of a project to open it.
. Click *New* > *<Type> Run Configuration*.
. Complete the *Create production configuration* form. The shown parameters depend on the configuration type:
+
* *Settings*
+
** *Priority*
+
Enter a number between 1 and 200 to specify the priority of the process run. Deployed processes are inserted in a session queue according to their priority. Process configurations with lower numbers are considered higher priority and are executed before configurations of lower priority.
Invocable and on-demand run configurations always have highest priority.
* *Activity Parameter*
+
The activity parameters for each process are created in RPA Builder and are given initial values there. You can overwrite these values with new initial values by double-clicking on the relevant field in the *Value* column.
+
Set a value by entering text or by clicking on a checkbox, and complete your entry by pressing ENTER.
+
[[production-configuration-link-globals]]
Alternatively, you can set the value of an activity parameter by linking it with a global variable. To link the parameter to a variable, click *Link a global activity parameter* (image:linkglobalvariable-icon.png[link symbol,1.5%,1.5%]) and select a variable. RPA Manager displays variables of the same type, assigned to the production phase, and only the credentials to which you're xref:processautomation-prepare-deployment-credential.adoc#form-create-credential-useraffiliation[affiliated]. If a credential affiliated to another user is already linked, RPA Manager displays a row of stars to hide the data. 
+
The variables are typed. You can only enter or link values of the same type. The values entered here are start values, which can be overwritten by other values during the process run.
* *User Task*:
+
User tasks are elements of a process model, which a bot can't process fully automatically by a bot, but which require the support of a human. Specify which users are to process the user tasks by clicking on the *User Assignment or  User Group Assignment* icon. The table displays number of assigned users and user groups. You can specify both users and user groups at the same time. The user task is then displayed to each specified user until a user reserves it for processing.
+
Select the checkbox *Send email notification to all related users* when the task is ready for processing if you want all specified users to receive an email as soon as they're supposed to process a user task. This email contains the name of the user task, the process, and the project manager, as well as a prompt to review the pending tasks in the *My RPA* module.
* *Execution*:
+
Decide whether to carry out the productive run in an existing console or RDP session or in a Secure Session, and specify an appropriate user.
+
You can link the user with a global credential variable by clicking on the *Link a credential from credential pool* icon.
+
Use the syntax `domain\username` instead of `username@domain.com` for domain users and `username` for local users, regardless of whether you enter the username manually or link a global credential.
+
Ensure that the bot that you want to execute the process is configured for the execution type, because you can't save the run configuration otherwise.

[[runconfig-execution-enabletaskbar]] If you want to watch the execution of the process in the *Process Streaming* view of the *Process Monitoring* module or if the process uses elements of the Windows operating system like the start menu or the task bar, check *Enable Taskbar (Start menu, taskbar buttons)*.
* *Schedule*:
+
[%collapsible]
.*Keep in mind that Bots might live in different time zones.*
==== 

'''

You create a schedule without specifying a time zone. The bot you assign the production configuration to executes the process at the specified times in its local time. The time intervals might change, depending on daylight saving time.

For example, if you work in Buenos Aires (ART (UTC -3)), specify a schedule that starts at 5:30 AM and ends at 9:30 PM and assign the configuration to three bots installed on computers in Berlin, San Francisco, and Tokyo, the bots don't execute the processes simultaneously:

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|*Bot* |*Execution Time in the Bot's Local Time Zone* |*Execution Time in the Buenos Aires User's Local Time Zone*

|Berlin bot
|5:30 AM - 9:30 PM (Berlin time,  (CET (UTC +1)) =
|1:30 AM - 5:30 PM (Buenos Aires time (ART (UTC -3)))

|San Francisco bot
|5:30 AM - 9:30 PM (San Francisco time, (PST (UTC -8)) =
|10:30 AM - 2:30 AM (Buenos Aires time (ART (UTC -3)))

|Tokyo bot
|5:30 AM - 9:30 PM (Tokyo time, JST (UTC +9)) =
|5:30 PM - 9:30 AM (Buenos Aires time (ART (UTC -3)))

|===

The bot checks every minute whether it's within a scheduled time frame and within its service time and whether the required process applications are outside all downtimes. The process isn't executed if the executing bot is outside its service time or if one or more of the process applications used by the bot are within a downtime.

'''

====
+
Invocable and on-demand run configurations don't have schedules.
+
For a scheduled run configuration, choose the schedule type:
+
[IMPORTANT]
Interval and Cron expression scheduling are supported by bots running version 1.7.0 or later.
+
** *Interval*
Enter the interval to repeat the process. The process starts once at the beginning of each interval.
+
The intervals are equidistant in the defined time frame. For example, `Repeat my process every 10 minutes`. 
+
If you need a more complex interval, use *Cron expression*.
+
** *Cron expression*
+
Enter a Cron expression to repeat the process. The process starts once at the beginning of each interval.
+
The intervals aren't equidistant. For example, `Run my process on minutes 3, 11, and 48 of every hour between 08:00 AM and 10:42 PM, only on Monday and Friday, only in February until April, and in November`.
+
If you need a simpler interval, use *Interval*.
+
You can use the Cron expression helper to compile the expresssion and check the natural language schedule summary.
+
.What is a Cron expression?
[%collapsible]
=====

'''

Cron is a widely used standard for describing time and date information. You use a cron expression to define complex intervals, for example, `Run my process on minutes 3, 11, and 48 of every hour between 08:00 AM and 10:42 PM, only on Monday and Friday, only in February until April, and in November.

The scheduler keeps track of every minute and starts the process run when the Cron expression matches the bot's time-date setting. You can trigger the event just once or at regular intervals.

A date-time expression in the Cron format used by RPA Manager consists of five required settings in the following order:

. Minutes (`0`-`59`)
. Hours (`0`-`23`)
. Day of month (`1`-`31`)
. Month (`1`-`12`)
. Day of the week (`0`-`7`), where Sunday is either `0` or `7`

The Scheduler component also supports the following special characters:

* `*`: All values within the range of valid values.
* `-`: Range of values within the range of valid values, for example, `1-3`.
* `,`: Additional values within the range of valid values, for example, `1,7`.
* `/`: Incremental values within the range of valid values starting with the first specified value, for example, `1/7`.

You can set either the day of the week or day of the month, but not both. Replace either the day of the week or day of the month with an asterisk.

The Scheduler supports most standard Cron expressions. Here are a few good and bad examples:

[%header,cols="3*"]
|===
|Expression |Behavior |Explanation 
|`5 4 3 2 1` | At 04:05 AM on every Monday in every February and (?) on the 3rd of every February| This Cron expression is invalid. You can set either the day of the week or day of the month, but not both. Replace either the day of the week or day of the month with an asterisk. If you want to run a process exactly once on a specific time, you must specify the day of the month but not the day of the week. See next two examples. 
|`5 4 3 2 *` | At 04:05 AM on the 3rd of every February| If you want to run a process exactly once on a specific time, you must specify the day of the month but not the day of the week. You can't specify the year. 
|`5 4 * 2 3` | At 04:05 AM on every Wednesday of every February| If you want to run a process exactly once on a specific time, you must specify the day of the month but not the day of the week.You can't specify the year. 
|`*/7 * * * *` |Run at minute 00, 07, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56 of every hour (of every day of every month on every weekday). |Starts at minute 0 because it's the first of all values in the valid range (*).
|`45/05 * * * *` |Run at minutes 45, 50, and 55 of every hour |
|`* * * * *` |Run every minute forever |
|`* 9-16 * * 1-5` |Every minute, between 09:00 AM and 04:59 PM, Monday through Friday |
|`00,10,42 9-16 1-10,20-30 2-7,12 *`` |At 0, 10, and 42 minutes past the hour, between 09:00 AM and 04:59 PM, on day 1 through 10 and 20 through 30 of the month, and on Friday, only in February through July and December |You can combine lists and ranges.
|===

Non-existant times, such as 'missing hours' during daylight savings conversion, never match the bot's time-date setting, causing processes scheduled during the 'missing times' not to run. Similarly, times that occur more than once (again, during daylight savings conversion) cause matching processes to run twice.

'''
=====
+
** *Calendar Scheduling*
+
Use this option to edit run configurations that already use calendar scheduling.
+ 
Add one or more fixed schedules within which the productive run is carried out continuously. For each schedule, define time intervals within which the process is executed. RPA Manager combines all schedules to compute the execution times.
+
.How does calendar scheduling work?
[%collapsible]
=====

'''

You can create multiple schedules. These may also overlap. All schedules together make up a time frame within which the process may be executed. The executing bot checks every minute whether it's within this time frame or not. A new process run isn't started until all conditions have been fulfilled.

For this reason, the executing bot checks every minute whether it's within a service time and whether the required process applications are outside all downtimes. The process isn't executed if the executing bot is outside its service time or if one or more of the process applications used by the bot are within a downtime.

Running processes are always executed completely.

When creating new schedules, pay attention to whether the new schedules overlap with schedules of other configurations and ensure that the executing bots have enough free sessions. Otherwise, trigger executions might be skipped.

Click on the button *Add Schedule* to assign a (further) schedule to this configuration and complete the *Create a new schedule* form:
