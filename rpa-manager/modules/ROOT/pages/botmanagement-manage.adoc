= Managing Bots

Bots can be licensed to use secure sessions. Some properties, like name, service times, and phase permissions can be edited. Deinstalled bots can be removed from RPA Manager.

== Before You begin

* At least one bot must be installed on a separate computer.
* If you want to assign secure sessions to a bot, make sure that a terminal server software is installed on the computer of the bot.
* If you want to assign service times to a bot, you need to create them in the *Service Times* view of the *Bot Management* module first.
* If you want to assign process applications to a bot, you need to create them in the *Process Applications* view of the *Process Automation* module first.

== License Bots for Secure Sessions

If bots should run processes in a hidden session, assign them secure session licenses.

The number of secure sessions that can be assigned and served by the bot depends on the hardware of the computer on which the bot is installed
Please refer to the system and hardware requirements topic to assess the maximum number of secure sessions for the bot.

. In the *Bots* view of the *Bot Management* module, click *Secure Session Assignment*.
. Set the number of sessions the bot may use.
. Click *Save*.

== Assign Service Times and Process Applications to Bots

Assign service times to bots to determine when a bot may execute processes.

Assign process applications to bots that can access them.

. In the *Bots* view of the *Bot Management* module, click the *Edit* icon image:edit-icon.png[pen-to-square symbol,1.5%,1.5%] in the row of the bot you want to edit.
. In the form *<bot name>* click on all service times and applications you want to assign.
. Click *Save*.

== Edit a Bot

Edit a bot to change its properties. Hostname, IP address, version, and timezone are fixed values taken from the computer the bot is installed on.

. In the *Bots* view of the *Bot Management* module, click the *Edit* icon image:edit-icon.png[pen-to-square symbol,1.5%,1.5%] in the row of the bot you want to edit.
. Edit the form <*bot name*>.
. Click *Save*.

== Remove a Bot

After deinstallation or reconfiguration, a bot is still shown in the *Bots* view. You need to manually remove the bot from the view.

If you accidentally remove a bot that is still being executed, it will reappear in the view the next time it reports to the RPA Manager. In this case, however, the licenses, name, description, assigned process applications and service times, and tasks will be lost and have to be assigned again. Deleted bots are removed from process configurations. Any active processes are terminated.

. In the *Bots* view of the *Bot Management* module, click the *Remove* icon image:delete-icon.png[trash symbol,1.5%,1.5%] in the row of the bot you want to remove.
. Confirm the removal.
