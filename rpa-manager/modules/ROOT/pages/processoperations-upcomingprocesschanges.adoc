= Upcoming Process Changes

RPA developers save activities that can be reused in different processes, such as login procedures or creation of data sets, in the activity library of the RPA Builder. To reuse a saved activity, an RPA developer can import a reference to this activity into a bot task. 

If an RPA developer edits a referenced activity, RPA Manager shows a label with the number of changed activities next to the navigation items *Process Operations* and *Upcoming Process Changes*. 

In the view *Upcoming Process Changes* you can see which processes contain the changed activities and deploy the newest version.

== View Upcoming Process Changes 

If you see a label with a number next to the *Process Operations* or *Upcoming Process Changes* navigation entry, an RPA developer has edited an activity in the activity library in RPA Builder.

To view the changes:

. Open the *Upcoming Process Changes* view in the *Process Operations* module.
. View the table.
. To compare the deployed version with the latest version of an activity, click the *Show Changes* icon image:show-icon.png[eye symbol,1.5%,1.5%] in the table row of the activity.

== Map BPMN Element Names to Process Activities

If a process contains the same activity more than once, use your browser's developer tools to find out which activity contaims the reference:

. Open the *Upcoming Process Changes* view in the *Process Operations* module.
. Right-click on a process name, open the project in another tab and open the *Automation* panel there.
. In the *Automation* panel, right-click on one of the possible activities and choose *Inspect*. 

The *Elements* panel of the browser shows the highlighted source code of the element. 

To map this element to an element shown in the *Upcoming Process Changes* table:

. In the *Elements* panel, look up the text next to *data-element-id=* contained in the source code belonging to the highlighted text.
. Switch back to the *Upcoming Process Changes* tab.
. Compare the *data-element-id* with the *Activity Reference Name* in the list of all process changes.
