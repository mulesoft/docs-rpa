= Manage Applications

In the *Process Applications* view, you list all applications required for the execution of processes. Create a new entry for each instance of an application.

In the *Process Management* view, the project manager xref:myrpa-start.adoc#required-process-applications[assigns required applications to a process] at process creation or phase transition.

In the module *Bot Management*, the administrator xref:botmanagement-manage.adoc#bot-assign-servicetimes-applications[assigns required applications to bots] that can execute them. Bots can execute all applications installed on their computer.

Applications are not available during down-times or while deactivated. A member of the process team can deploy a process on a bot that has assigned the required processes. If an application becomes non-available, the bot completes running processes using that application and restarts them when the downtime or deactivation period has ended.

Learn how to xref:botmanagement-manage.adoc#bot-assign-servicetimes-applications[assign required applications to a bot].

The administrator can deploy a process on a bot that has assigned the required applications.

== Before You Begin

* Ask an administrator to xref:usermanagement-manage.adoc#assign-privileges-to-a-user[assign you the needed privileges]:

[cols="1,2"]

* For each application, note the timezone of the computer that it is installed on.

== Create a Process Application

Create one entry for each application required for the execution of processes.

To avoid confusion, append the name of the time zone to the name of the application or the downtime. For example, name your application `Words - Tokyo` and your downtime `Electrical Power Outage Tokyo`.

To create a process application:

. Open the *Process Applications* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click *Create*.
. [[form-create-process-applications]] Complete the *Create a new application* form:
+
* *Time Zone*:
+
Time zone for defining downtimes.
+
Specify a downtime in the time zone in which it occurs. If the bot that you assign the downtime to is installed on a computer that uses a different time zone, the downtime interval is converted to the botâ€™s time zone. If you assign the application to multiple bots in different time zones, all bots pause executing processes that use that application simultaneously. The time intervals might change, depending on daylight saving time.
+
For example, if you specify a downtime that starts at 1:30 AM and ends at 5:30 AM in Tokyo time (JST (UTC +9)) and the bot is installed on a computer in San Francisco (PST (UTC -8)), the bot does not execute processes between 8:30 AM and 12:30 PM in San Francisco time.
+
To avoid confusion, append the name of the time zone to the name of the downtime. For example, name your downtime `Electrical Power Outage Tokyo`.
+
* *Downtimes*
+
Click *Create* to add a downtime to the application.
. Click *Save*.

== Edit an Application

Edit an application to change its data or down-times:

. Open the *Process Applications* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click *Create*.
. Edit the form *Edit the application*.
+
For an explanation of the properties, see  <<form-create-process-applications, *Create an Application*>>.
. Click *Save*.

== Deactivate or Activate a Process Application

Deactivate an application if it is temporarily not available and you don't know when it will be available again.

Use down-times to schedule maintenance and planned downtimes. Deactivation periods are not added to the list of down-times.

Applications are not available during down-times or while deactivated. A member of the process team can deploy a process on a bot that has assigned the required processes. If an application becomes non-available, the bot completes running processes using that application and restarts them when the downtime or deactivation period has ended.

If an application is not available, deactivate it:

. Open the *Process Applications* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click the *Deactivate* icon image:deactivate-icon.png[toggle-on symbol,1.5%,1.5%] on the panel of the application you want to deactivate.

RPA Manager displays an *Inactive* label beneath the logo of the application.

If a deactivated application becomes available again, activate it:

. Open the *Process Applications* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click the *Activate* icon image:activate-icon.png[toggle-off symbol,1.5%,1.5%] on the panel of the application you want to activate.

RPA Manager displays an *Active* label beneath the logo of the application.

== Remove a Process Application

Remove an application if it is no longer available:

. Open the *Process Applications* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click the the *Remove* icon image:delete-icon.png[trash symbol,1.5%,1.5%] on the panel of the application you want to remove.
. Confirm the removal.

RPA Manager removes the application from all processes and bots to which it was assigned to.
