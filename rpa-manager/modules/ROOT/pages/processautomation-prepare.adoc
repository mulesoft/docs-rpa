Learn how to xref:myrpa-start.adoc#projectdata-category[organize a project into a category].

The project manager lists all applications that are used in processes and assigns applications to processes that use them. IT administrators assign applications to bots which can use them. A process can be deployed on a bot which has assigned the required applications.

Learn how to <<manage-applications, manage applications>>.

Learn how to xref:myrpa-start.adoc#projectdata-processapplications[assign applications to processes].

Learn how to xref:botmanagement-manage.adoc#bot-assign-servicetimes-applications[assign applications to bots].

Global variables and credentials are used for values that are the same in multiple processes and which frequently change. This way you can reduce the time involved and the error rate in the maintenance of your processes. You can link global variables and credentials anywhere that a globe symbol is displayed.

[[manage-categories]]
=== Manage Categories

The project manager organizes projects into categories. A category describes the environment of a process in a few keywords, for example `Customer Support Mystical University` or `Finance`.

A project can only belong to a single category.

First, create a standard category, so you can start with process automation quickly. You can change the category of a process later. After you have automated the first projects, it makes sense to create an archive category and move completed projects there.

==== Create a Category

Create categories to organize processes. Assign a process to a category during evaluation or project creation.

. In the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module, click *Create*.
. Enter a name in the *Create a category* window.
. Click *OK*.

==== Edit a Category

Edit a category to render its name more precisely.

. In the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module, click the *Edit* icon image:edit-icon.png[pen-to-square symbol,1.5%,1.5%] on the panel of the category you want to edit.
. Change the name in the *Edit the category* window.
. Click *OK*.

==== Remove a Category

Remove categories you no longer need.

Only categories that do not contain processes can be deleted.

. In the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module, click the the *Delete* icon image:delete-icon.png[trash symbol,1.5%,1.5%] on the panel of the category you want to delete.

[[manage-applications]]
=== Manage Process Applications

In the view *Process Applications*, list all applications required for the execution of processes. In the view *Process Management*, assign required applications to processes at process creation or phase transition. In the module *Bot Management*, assign applications to a bot that can execute them. Bots can execute all applications installed on their computer.

Learn how to xref:myrpa-start.adoc#required-process-applications[assign required applications to a process].

Learn how to xref:botmanagement-manage.adoc#bot-assign-servicetimes-applications[assign required applications to a bot].

You can deploy a process on a bot which has assigned the required applications.

Down times are repeatable time intervals that define when an application is not available. Processes whose applications are currently down are executed to completion and are not restarted until the downtime period has ended.

You specify a down time in one time-zone. If the bot that you assign the down time to is installed on a computer using a different time zone, the down time interval is converted to the bot’s time zone.

For example, if you specify a down time starting at 1:30 AM and ending at 5:30 AM in Tokyo time (JST (UTC +9)) and the bot is installed on a computer in San Francisco (PST (UTC -8)), the bot will not execute processes between 8:30 AM and 12:30 PM in San Francisco time. If you assign the application to multiple bots in different time zones, all bots will pause executing processes using that application simultaneously.

The time intervals may change depending on daylight saving time.

==== Create a Process Application

Create one entry for each application required for the execution of processes:

. In the *Process Applications* view of the *Process Automation* module, click *Create*.
. Complete the form *Create a new application*:
+
* *Time Zone*:
+
Time zone for defining downtimes.
+
You specify a down time in one time-zone. If the bot that you assign the down time to is installed on a computer using a different time zone, the down time interval is converted to the bot’s time zone.
+
For example, if you specify a down time starting at 1:30 AM and ending at 5:30 AM in Tokyo time (JST (UTC +9)) and the bot is installed on a computer in San Francisco (PST (UTC -8)), the bot will not execute processes between 8:30 AM and 12:30 PM in San Francisco time. If you assign the application to multiple bots in different time zones, all bots will pause executing processes using that application simultaneously.
+
The time intervals may change depending on daylight saving time.
+
* *Downtimes*
+
Click *Create* to add a downtime to the application.
. Click *Save*.

==== Edit a Process Application

Edit an application to change its data or down-times:

. In the *Process Applications* view of the *Process Automation* module, click *Create*.
. Edit the form *Edit the application*.
. Click *Save*.

==== Deactivate or Activate a Process Application

Deactivate an application if it is temporarily not available and you don't know when it will be available again.

Use down-times to schedule maintenance and down times. Deactivation periods are not added to the list of down-times.

Processes whose applications are currently down are executed to completion and are not restarted until the downtime or deactivation period has ended.

. In the *Process Applications* view of the *Process Automation* module, click the *Deactivate* icon image:deactivate-icon.png[toggle-on symbol,1.5%,1.5%] on the panel of the application you want to deactivate.

An *Inactive* label is shown beneath the logo of the application.

If a deactivated application becomes available again, you can activate it:

. In the *Process Applications* view of the *Process Automation* module, click the *Activate* icon image:activate-icon.png[toggle-off symbol,1.5%,1.5%] on the panel of the application you want to activate.

An *Active* label is shown beneath the logo of the application.

==== Remove a Process Application

Remove an application if it is no longer available.

. In the *Process Applications* view of the *Process Automation* module, click the the *Remove* icon image:delete-icon.png[trash symbol,1.5%,1.5%] on the panel of the application you want to remove.
. Confirm the removal.

The application is removed from all processes and RPA Bots to which it was assigned to without further confirmation.

== Prepare Deployment

Use global variables or credentials for values and login data that are the same in multiple processes and which frequently change. This way you can reduce the time involved and the error rate in the maintenance of your processes.

You can link global variables or credentials anywhere that a globe symbol is displayed. A link symbol indicates an existing link. You can change and delete links.

[[manage-globalvariables]]
=== Manage Global Variables

Create global variables for values that are the same in multiple processes and which frequently change. This way you can reduce the time involved and the error rate in the maintenance of your processes.

You can link global variables anywhere that a globe symbol is displayed. A link symbol indicates an existing link. You can change and delete links.

Editing or deleting a global variable affects all configurations which use the variable.

Check the usage of a variable before changing or deleting it.

==== Create a Global Variable

A global variable consists of a name, a description, a type, and a value. It may be used in the test or the production phase.

Use global variables for values that are the same in multiple processes and which frequently change. This way you can reduce the time involved and the error rate in the maintenance of your processes.

Use descriptive names for global variables and only use the variables in an appropriate context. If, for example, the number 42 happens to be both the number of employees in your company and the answer to a different question, then create two global variables (number_employees and answer).

. In the *Global Variables* view of the *Process Automation* module, click *Create*.
. Complete the form *Create a New Global Variable*:
* *Phase affiliation*:
+
Phases in which the variable is permitted to be deployed. When users create or change the variable, each user's individual privileges determine which phases the user can select:
+
** *Test*:
+
The variable can be deployed in the test phase.
+
** *Production*:
+
The variable can be deployed in the production phase.

* *Type*:
+
Type of the global variable. The type of variable determines where it can be used. The original value defined in RPA Builder is typed. Select one of the following types:
+
** *Integer*:
+
An integer number.
** *Alphanumeric*:
+
A character string.
** *Boolean*:
+
A logical value. Set the checkmark in the *Value* checkbox for the value `true` and remove the checkmark for the value `false`.
** *Float*:
+
A floating-point number.
** *Coordinate*:
+
Combination of two integer values for an X-Y coordinate. Use global coordinates, for example, as an offset to determine a screen coordinate.
* *Value*:
+
You can only enter values of the specified type.

You can link global variables anywhere that a globe symbol is displayed. A link symbol indicates an existing link. You can change and delete links.

==== Check the Usage of a Global Variable

Before editing a global variable, check its usage to avoid inadvertent side-effects.

. In the *Global Variables* view of the *Process Automation* module, click the *Usage* icon image:usage-icon.png[binoculars symbol,1.5%,1.5%] in the table row of the global variable you want to check.

A window with a table shows you the configurations in which the global variable is used.

====  Edit a Global Variable

Edit a global variable to change its name or value. You cannot change the type of a global variable. Check the usage of the variable first to avoid inadvertent side-effects.

. In the *Global Variables* view of the *Process Automation* module, click the *Edit* icon image:edit-icon.png[pen-to-square symbol,1.5%,1.5%] in the table row of the global variable you want to edit.
. Change data in the form *Edit the Global Variable*.
. Click *Save*.

The variable is changed everywhere it is used.

==== Delete a Global Variable

Delete global variables that will not be used anymore. Variables linked in configurations cannot be deleted.

. In the *Global Variables* view of the *Process Automation* module, click the *Delete* icon image:delete-icon.png[trash symbol,1.5%,1.5%] in the table row of the global variable you want to delete.
. Confirm the deletion.

[[manage-credentials]]
=== Manage Credentials

Credentials store login data for applications or web services. They can be used with different processes. Passwords are encrypted.

You can create the following types of credentials:

* *AWS Credentials*
+
for accessing Amazon Web Services
* *User Account Credentials*
+
for accessing all other kinds of applications

You can link credentials anywhere that a globe symbol is displayed. A link symbol indicates an existing link. You can change and delete links.

Editing or deleting a credential affects all configurations that use the credential.

Check the usage of a credential before changing or deleting it.

==== Create Credentials

Create credentials with which a bot can login to an external application during process runs.

. In the *Credential Pool* view of the *Process Automation* module, click *Create*.
. Complete the form *Create a New Credential*:
* *Phase affiliation*:
+
Phases in which the credential is permitted to be deployed. When users create or change the credential, each user's individual privileges determine which phases the user can select:
+
** *Test*:
+
The credential can be deployed in the test phase.
+
** *Production*:
+
The credential can be deployed in the production phase.

* *Type*:
+
Type of the global credential. The type of credential determines where it can be used. The original value defined in RPA Builder is typed. Select one of the following types:
+
** *AWS Credentials*:
+
The credential is used for accessing Amazon Web Services. Fill in the client ID, client secret and region. Using a session token is optional.
** *User Account Credentials*
