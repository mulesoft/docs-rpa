* Process team members can link global variables and credentials to activity parameters in automations. The RPA developer defines activity parameters for a process in RPA Builder. When you link global variables or credentials in a run configuration you overwrite the initial value of the activity parameter.

== Prepare Projects

Project managers organize projects into categories. A category describes the environment of a process in a few keywords.

Administrators list available applications and assign them to bots which can access them. Citizen technologists assign used applications to processes. You can deploy a process on a bot which has assigned the required processes.

You use global variables and credentials for values that are the same in multiple processes and which frequently change. This way you can reduce the time involved and the error rate in the maintenance of your processes. You can link global variables and credentials anywhere that a globe symbol is displayed.

=== Manage Categories

Project managers organize projects into categories. A category describes the environment of a process in a few keywords.

A project can only belong to a single category. First, create a standard category, so you can start with process automation quickly. You can change the category of a process later. After you have automated the first projects, create an archive category and move completed projects there.

==== Create a Category

Create categories to group processes.

Assign a process to a category during evaluation or project creation.

. Open the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click *Create*.
. Enter a name in the *Create a category* window.
. Click *OK*.

==== Edit a Category

Edit a category to render its name more precisely.

. Open the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click the *Edit* icon image:edit-icon.png[pen-to-square symbol,1.5%,1.5%] on the panel of the category you want to edit.
. Change the name in the *Edit the category* window.
. Click *OK*.

==== Remove a Category

Remove categories you no longer need.

You can only remove categories that do not contain processes.

. Open the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click the the *Remove* icon image:delete-icon.png[trash symbol,1.5%,1.5%] on the panel of the category you want to delete.

=== Manage Applications

In the view *Process Applications*, you list all applications required for the execution of processes.

In the view *Process Management*, the project manager assigns required applications to processes at process creation or phase transition. In the module *Bot Management*, the administrator assigns applications to bots that can execute them. Bots can execute all applications installed on their computer.

Applications are not available during down-times or while deactivated. A member of the process team can deploy a process on a bot which has assigned the required processes. The bot executes processes whose applications are currently down to completion and restarts them when the downtime or deactivation period has ended.

==== Create an Application

Create one entry for each application required for the execution of processes:

. Open the *Process Applications* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click *Create*.
. [[form-create-process-applictions]] Complete the form *Create a new application*:
+
* *Time Zone*:
+
Time zone for defining downtimes.
* *Downtimes*
+
Click *Create* to add a downtime to the application.
. Click *Save*.

Learn how to xref:myrpa-start.adoc#required-process-applications[assign required applications to a process].

Learn how to xref:botmanagement-manage.adoc#bot-assign-servicetimes-applications[assign required applications to a bot].

==== Edit an Application

Edit an application to change its data or down-times:

. Open the *Process Applications* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click *Create*.
. Edit the form *Edit the application*.
+
The properties are explained in the form <<form-create-process-applictions, *Create a new application*>>.
. Click *Save*.

==== Deactivate or Activate an Application

Deactivate an application if it is temporarily not available and you don't know when it will be available again.

Use down-times to schedule maintenance and planned down times. Deactivation periods are not added to the list of down-times.

RPA Bots execute processes whose applications are currently down to completion and do not restart them until the downtime or deactivation period has ended.

If a application is not available, deactivate it:

. Open the *Process Applications* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click the *Deactivate* icon image:deactivate-icon.png[toggle-on symbol,1.5%,1.5%] on the panel of the application you want to deactivate.

RPA Manager shows an *Inactive* label beneath the logo of the application.

If a deactivated application becomes available again, activate it:

. Open the *Process Applications* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click the *Activate* icon image:activate-icon.png[toggle-off symbol,1.5%,1.5%] on the panel of the application you want to activate.

RPA Manager shows an *Active* label beneath the logo of the application.

==== Remove an Application

Remove an application if it is no longer available:

. Open the *Process Applications* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click the the *Remove* icon image:delete-icon.png[trash symbol,1.5%,1.5%] on the panel of the application you want to remove.
. Confirm the removal.

RPA Manager removes the application from all processes and RPA Bots to which it was assigned to.

== Prepare Deployment

Use global variables or credentials for values and login data that are the same in multiple processes and which frequently change. This way you can reduce the time involved and the error rate in the maintenance of your processes.

A member of the process team can link global variables or credentials anywhere that a globe symbol is displayed. A link symbol indicates an existing link. You can change and delete links.



=== Manage Global Variables

Create global variables for values that are the same in multiple processes and which frequently change. This way you can reduce the time involved and the error rate in the maintenance of your processes.

You can link global variables anywhere that a globe symbol is displayed. A link symbol indicates an existing link. You can change and delete links.

By linking a global variable or credential you overwrite the initial value of an activity parameter that an RPA Developer has defined for the process implementation in RPA Builder.

Editing or deleting a global variable affects all configurations which use the variable.

Check the usage of a variable before changing or deleting it.

==== Create a Global Variable

A global variable consists of a name, a description, a type, and a value. It may be used in the test or the production phase.

Use descriptive names for global variables and only use the variables in an appropriate context. If, for example, the number 42 happens to be both the number of employees in your company and the answer to a different question, then create two global variables (number_employees and answer).

. Open the *Global Variables* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click *Create*.
. [[form-create-globalvariable]] Complete the form *Create a New Global Variable*:
* *Phase affiliation*:
+
Phases in which the variable is permitted to be deployed. When you create or change the variable, your individual privileges determine which phases you can select:
+
** *Test*:
+
The variable can be deployed in the test phase.
+
** *Production*:
+
The variable can be deployed in the production phase.

* *Type*:
+
Type of the global variable. The type of variable determines where it can be used. The original value defined in RPA Builder is typed. Select one of the following types:
+
** *Integer*:
+
An integer number.
** *Alphanumeric*:
+
A character string.
** *Boolean*:
+
A logical value. Set the checkmark in the *Value* checkbox for the value `true` or remove the checkmark for the value `false`.
** *Float*:
+
A floating-point number.
** *Coordinate*:
+
Combination of two integer values for an X-Y coordinate. Use global coordinates, for example, as an offset to determine a screen coordinate.
* *Value*:
+
You can only enter values of the specified type.

You can link global variables anywhere that a globe symbol is displayed. A link symbol indicates an existing link. You can change and delete links.

==== Check the Usage of a Global Variable

Before editing a global variable, check its usage to avoid inadvertent side-effects.

. Open the *Global Variables* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click the *Usage* icon image:usage-icon.png[binoculars symbol,1.5%,1.5%] in the table row of the global variable you want to check.

A window with a table shows you the configurations in which the global variable is used.

====  Edit a Global Variable

Edit a global variable to change its name or value. You cannot change the type of a global variable. Check the usage of the variable first to avoid inadvertent side-effects.

. Open the *Global Variables* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click the *Edit* icon image:edit-icon.png[pen-to-square symbol,1.5%,1.5%] in the table row of the global variable you want to edit.
. Change data in the form *Edit the Global Variable*.
+
The properties are explained in the form <<form-create-globalvariable, *Create a New Global Variable*>>.
. Click *Save*.

The variable is changed everywhere it is used.

==== Delete a Global Variable

Delete global variables that no one will use anymore. You cannot delete variables linked in configurations.

. Open the *Global Variables* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click the *Delete* icon image:delete-icon.png[trash symbol,1.5%,1.5%] in the table row of the global variable you want to delete.
. Confirm the deletion.

=== Manage Credentials

Credentials store login data for applications or web services. You can use them with different processes. Passwords are encrypted.

You can create the following types of credentials:

* *AWS Credentials*
+
for accessing Amazon Web Services
* *OAuth Credentials*
+
for accessing the Microsoft Outlook email application via Microsoft Azure.
* *User Account Credentials*
+
for accessing all other kinds of applications

You can link credentials anywhere that a globe symbol is displayed. A link symbol indicates an existing link. You can change and delete links.

Editing or deleting a credential affects all configurations that use the credential.

Check the usage of a credential before changing or deleting it.

==== Create Credentials

Create credentials with which a bot can login to an external application during process runs.

. Open the *Credential Pool* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click *Create*.
. [[form-create-credential]] Complete the form *Create a New Credential*:
* *Phase affiliation*:
+
Phases in which the credential is permitted to be deployed. When you create or change the credential, your privileges determine which phases the user can select:
+
** *Test*:
+
The credential can be deployed in the test phase.
+
** *Production*:
+
The credential can be deployed in the production phase.

* *Type*:
+
Type of the global credential. The type of credential determines where you can use it. The original value defined in RPA Builder is typed. Select one of the following types:
+
** *AWS Credentials*:
+
Use this credential for accessing Amazon Web Services. Fill in the client ID, client secret and region. Using a session token is optional.
** *OAuth Credentials*
+
Use this credential for accessing the Microsoft Outlook email application via Microsoft Azure.
+
*** *OAuth Host*:
+
The host address used to get the credentials. The default address for Outlook services is https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/ . This address might change if the customer uses a self hosted service.
*** *Client ID*:
+
To authenticate with the OAuth Host, an Azure application has to be defined in the customers space. This Azure application has an id, that is unique in the entire OAuth Host space and allows a user to explicitly grant or revoke access for this Azure application to his account.
+
For more information how to create this Azure application for Outlook, see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app[Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform^]
*** *Client Secret*
+
This secret allows RPA Manager to prove to the OAuth Host, that it has received the permission to access user accounts on behalf of the registered Azure application. Without it the authentication is not possible.
*** *Redirect URI*
+
This is the URI to which the OAuth Host will redirect after the user has completed the authentication attempt. This redirect URI has to be registered with the Azure application. Only if the entered redirect URI matches one of the registered URI, the OAuth Host will allow the authentication.
*** *Scopes*
+
The scopes define, which permission the user grants to the Azure application. By default, we request the following permissions:
+
**** `offline_access`
+
(*Required*) Enables access via a refresh token, which you can use to repeatedly log in to the mail services without requiring user interaction each time.
**** `https://outlook.office.com/IMAP.AccessAsUser.All`
+
(*Required* when using IMAP) Enables reading and moving emails from the Outlook IMAP server.
**** `https://outlook.office.com/POP.AccessAsUser.All`
+
(*Required* when using POP3) Enables reading emails from the Outlook POP3 server.
**** `https://outlook.office.com/SMTP.Send`
+
(*Required* when using SMTP) Enables sending emails from the Outlook SMTP server.
**** `openid email`
+
Enables RPA Manager to automatically detect the email account used to log in to the Azure application. If this scope is omitted, you must provide an email in RPA Builder.
+
*** *E-Mail Address*
+
Email address for accessing Outlook.
*** *Refresh Token*
+
Refresh token generated with the authentication properties.
+
Learn how to xref:rpa-builder::toolbox-variable-handling-credentials-for-oauth.adoc#generating-an-oauth-refresh-token[generate an OAuth refresh token with RPA Builder].
** *User Account Credentials*
+
Use this credential for accessing all other kinds of applications. Fill in the the username and password.
. Click *OK*.
