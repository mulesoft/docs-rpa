= Preparing Automations

Create and document the environment for the automation of processes.

== Before You Begin

* Obtain the needed privileges:

== Prepare Projects

Projects are assigned to categories. A category describes the environment of a process in a few keywords.

Applications that are used in processes are assigned to the process and to bots which can use them. A process can be deployed on a bot which has assigned the required processes.

Global variables and credentials are used for values that are the same in multiple processes and which frequently change. This way you can reduce the time involved and the error rate in the maintenance of your processes. You can link global variables and credentials anywhere that a globe symbol is displayed.

=== Manage Categories

Projects are assigned to categories. A category describes the environment of a process in a few keywords.

A project can only be assigned to a single category. First create a standard category, so you can start with process automation quickly. You can change the category of a process later. After you have automated the first projects, it makes sense to create an archive category and move completed projects there.

==== Create a Category

Create categories to group processes. Assign a process to a category during evaluation or project creation.

. In the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module, click *Create*.
. Enter a name in the *Create a category* window.
. Click *OK*.

==== Edit a Category

Edit a category to render its name more precisely.

. In the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module, click the *Edit* icon image:edit-icon.png[pen-to-square symbol,1.5%,1.5%] on the panel of the category you want to edit.
. Change the name in the *Edit the category* window.
. Click *OK*.

==== Remove a Category

Remove categories you no longer need.

Only categories that do not contain processes can be deleted.

. In the *Process Management* view of the *Process Automation* module, click the the *Delete* icon image:delete-icon.png[trash symbol,1.5%,1.5%] on the panel of the category you want to delete.

=== List Applications

List all applications required for the execution of processes. Assign required applications to processes. Assign applications installed on a computer a bot is installed on to that bot. Applications are not available during down-times. A process can be deployed on a bot which has assigned the required processes. During the down-time of a required application, the process cannot be executed.

. In the *Process Applications* view of the *Process Automation* module, click *Create*.
. Complete the form *Create a new application*:
+
* *Time Zone*:
+
Time zone for defining downtimes.
* *Downtimes*
+
Click *Create* to add a downtime to the application.

== Prepare Deployment

Use global variables or credentials for values and login data that are the same in multiple processes and which frequently change. This way you can reduce the time involved and the error rate in the maintenance of your processes.

You can link global variables or credentials anywhere that a globe symbol is displayed. A link symbol indicates an existing link. You can change and delete links.

=== Manage Global Variables

Create global variables for values that are the same in multiple processes and which frequently change. This way you can reduce the time involved and the error rate in the maintenance of your processes.

You can link global variables anywhere that a globe symbol is displayed. A link symbol indicates an existing link. You can change and delete links.

Editing or deleting a global variable affects all configurations which use the variable.

Check the usage of a variable before changing or deleting it.

==== Create a Global Variable

A global variable consists of a name, a description, a type, and a value. It may be used in the test or the production phase.

Use global variables for values that are the same in multiple processes and which frequently change. This way you can reduce the time involved and the error rate in the maintenance of your processes.

Use descriptive names for global variables and only use the variables in an appropriate context. If, for example, the number 42 happens to be both the number of employees in your company and the answer to a different question, then create two global variables (number_employees and answer).

. In the *Global Variables* view of the *Process Automation* module, click *Create*.
. Complete the form *Create a New Global Variable*:
* *Phase affiliation*:
+
Phases in which the variable is permitted to be deployed. When users create or change the variable, each user's individual privileges determine which phases the user can select:
+
** *Test*:
+
The variable can be deployed in the Test phase.
+
** *Production*:
+
The variable can be deployed in the Production phase.

* *Type*:
+
Type of the global variable. The type of variable determines where it can be used. The original value defined in RPA Builder is typed. Select one of the following types:
+
** *Integer*:
+
An integer number.
** *Alphaumeric*:
+
A character string.
** *Boolean*:
+
A logical value. Set the checkmark in the *Value* checkbox for the value `true` and remove the checkmark for the value `false`.
** *Float*:
+
A floating-point number.
** *Coordinate*:
+
Combination of two integer values for an X-Y coordinate. Use global coordinates, for example, as an offset to determine a screen coordinate.
* *Value*:
+
You can only enter values of the specified type.

You can link global variables anywhere that a globe symbol is displayed. A link symbol indicates an existing link. You can change and delete links.

==== Check the Usage of a Global Variable

Before editing a global variable, check its usage to avoid inadvertent side-effects.

. In the *Global Variables* view of the *Process Automation* module, click the *Usage* icon image:usage-icon.png[binoculars symbol,1.5%,1.5%] in the table row of the global variable you want to check.

A window with a table shows you in which configurations the variable is used.

====  Edit a Global Variable

Edit a global variable to change its name or value. You cannot change the type of a global variable. Check the usage of the variable first to avoid inadvertent side-effects.

. In the *Global Variables* view of the *Process Automation* module, click the *Edit* icon image:edit-icon.png[pen-to-square symbol,1.5%,1.5%] in the table row of the global variable you want to edit.
. Change date in the form *Edit the Global Variable*.
. Click *Save*.

The variable is changed everywhere it is used.

==== Delete a Global Variable

Delete global variables that will not be used anymore. Variables linked in configurations cannot be deleted.

. In the *Global Variables* view of the *Process Automation* module, click the *Delete* icon image:delete-icon.png[trash symbol,1.5%,1.5%] in the table row of the global variable you want to delete.
. Confirm the deletion.

=== Create Credentials

Credentials store login data for applications or web services. They can be used with different processes. Passwords are encrypted.

. In the *Credential Pool* view of the *Process Automation* module, click *Create*.
. Complete the form *Create a New Credential*.
. Click *OK*.
