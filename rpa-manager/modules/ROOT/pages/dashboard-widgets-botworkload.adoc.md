![rpa_Dashboard_Widgets_BotWorkload](img/rpa_Dashboard_Widgets_BotWorkload.png)

The **Bot Workload** widget shows how many of the sessions of an *X1 Bot* are [reserved](../../ProcessAutomation/ProcessManagement/rpa_processAutomation_ProcessManagement_Category_Project_Details_ProductionPhase_EN.md#reserved-session) for which [Production Configurations](../../ProcessAutomation/ProcessManagement/rpa_processAutomation_ProcessManagement_Category_Project_Details_ProductionPhase_EN.md#production-configurations) and how many are still free.

This gives you an overview of the utilization of your Robots and you can allocate resources flexibly.


## Data representation

The workloads of the Robots are displayed as a [Bar Chart](../../X1_Server/X1_Server_Basics/GUI/rpa_X1_Server_Basics_GUI_DataRepresentation_EN.md#balken-diagramme).

The individual bars have different colors depending on the allocation between free sessions and those reserved for individual production configurations.

## Configuration
