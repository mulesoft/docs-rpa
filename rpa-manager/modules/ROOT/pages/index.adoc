* Design and document RPA processes.
* Test and deploy automations.
* Manage and monitor deployed automations.

To access RPA Manager, navigate to `https://<tenant>.rpa.mulesoft.com`, where `<tenant>` represents your organization's instance. If you are not sure about this value, contact your organization's administrator.

Ensure that access to this URL is possible from your organization.
