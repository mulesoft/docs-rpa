= Manage Credentials

include::reuse::partial$rpa/iam-migration-affectedtopic-banner.adoc[]

Credentials store login data for external applications or web services. By using a credential, a bot can log in to an application during process runs. Passwords are encrypted. Only affiliated users can view, edit, and use the credentials.

You can create the following types of credentials:

* *AWS Credentials*
+
To access Amazon Web Services to use them with RPA Builder xref:rpa-builder::toolbox-aws-document-processing.adoc[Document Processing with AWS] action steps.
* *Connected App Credentials*
+
To access MuleSoft Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) via RPA Builder xref:rpa-builder::toolbox-mulesoft-idp.adoc[MuleSoft IDP] action steps.
* *Google API Service Account Credentials*
+
To access the Google API with the xref:rpa-builder::toolbox-google-drive-operations.adoc[Google Drive operation] action steps.
* *OAuth Credentials*
+
To access the Microsoft Outlook email application via Microsoft Azure with RPA Builder xref:rpa-builder::toolbox-mail-operations-mail-session-outlook-with-oauth.adoc[Mail Session (Outlook with OAuth)] action steps.
* *User Account Credentials*
+
To access all other kinds of applications.

Use descriptive names for credentials and only use them in an appropriate context. For example, if the employee `Nina` has an account for two applications, `Letters` and `Numbers`, create either two credentials (`nina_account_letters` and `nina_account_numbers`) or a single credential that includes both applications in its name (`nina_accounts_letters_numbers`).

Affiliated process team members can link global credentials to activity parameters in automations:

* xref:processautomation-deploy.adoc#test-configuration-link-globals[Linkable Activity Parameters in Test Configurations]
* xref:processautomation-deploy.adoc#production-configuration-link-globals[Linkable Activity Parameters in Production Configurations]

Editing or deleting a credential affects all configurations that use the credential.

Check the usage of a credential before changing or deleting it.

== Create a Credential

Create credentials that a bot can use to log in to an external application during process runs.

To create a credential:

. Open the *Credential Pool* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click *Create*.
. [[form-create-credential]] Complete the *Create a New Credential* form:
* [[form-create-credential-useraffiliation]] *User affiliation*
+
Select users that may view, edit, and use the credential. Add yourself so that you can also view, edit, and use the credential.
* *User group affiliation*
+
Select user groups whose members may view, edit, and use the credential. 
+
If you use an Anypoint account to login to RPA Manager, user groups are replaced by teams.
* *Phase affiliation*
+
Phases in which the credential can be deployed. When you create or change the credential, your privileges determine which phases the user can select:
+
** *Test*
+
The credential can be deployed in the test phase.
+
** *Production*
+
The credential can be deployed in the production phase.
* *Type*
+
Type of the global credential, which determines where you can use it. The original value defined in RPA Builder is typed. Select one of the following types:
+
** *AWS Credentials*
+
Use this credential to access Amazon Web Services. Fill in the client ID, client secret, and region. The session token is optional.
** *Connected App Credentials*
+
Use this credential to access MuleSoft Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) via RPA Builder action steps.
+
*** *Client ID*
+
Client ID of the connected app configured to call IDP.

*** *Client Secret*
+
Client Secret of the connected app configured to call IDP.
+
** *Google API Service Account Credentials*
+
Use this credential to access the Google API with the xref:rpa-builder::toolbox-google-drive-operations.adoc[Google Drive operation] action steps.
+
Click *Autofill from JSON* to import the authentication data from a credentials JSON file provided by your Google Cloud Console administrator. 
+
** *OAuth Credentials*
+
Use this credential to access the Microsoft Outlook email application via Microsoft Azure.
+
*** *OAuth Host*
+
The host address used to get the credentials. The default address for Outlook services is `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/`. This address might change if the customer uses a self hosted service.
*** *Client ID*
+
To authenticate with the OAuth Host, define an Azure application in your space. This Azure application has an ID, which is unique in the entire OAuth Host space, and that allows users to explicitly grant or revoke access for this Azure application to their accounts.
+
For more information about how to create this Azure application for Outlook, see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app[Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform^].
*** *Client Secret*
+
This secret enables RPA Manager to prove to the OAuth Host that it received permission to access user accounts on behalf of the registered Azure application. Without it, authentication is not possible.
*** *Redirect URI*
+
The URI to which the OAuth Host redirects after the user completes the authentication attempt. This redirect URI must be registered with the Azure application. The OAuth Host allows authentication only if the entered redirect URI matches one of the registered URIs.
*** *Scopes*
+
The scopes define which permissions you grant over your account to the Azure application. Separate the scopes to grant by blank spaces, for example `offline_access https://outlook.office.com/IMAP.AccessAsUser.All`. 
+
If you leave the scopes field empty, RPA Manager grants the following scopes by default:
+
**** `offline_access`
+
(*Required*) Enables access via a refresh token, which you can use to repeatedly log in to the mail services without requiring user interaction each time.
**** `https://outlook.office.com/IMAP.AccessAsUser.All`
+
(*Required* when using IMAP) Enables reading and moving emails from the Outlook IMAP server.
**** `https://outlook.office.com/POP.AccessAsUser.All`
+
(*Required* when using POP3) Enables reading emails from the Outlook POP3 server.
**** `https://outlook.office.com/SMTP.Send`
+
(*Required* when using SMTP) Enables sending emails from the Outlook SMTP server.
**** `openid email`
+
Enables RPA Manager to automatically detect the email account used to log in to the Azure application. If this scope is omitted, you must provide an email in RPA Builder.
*** *E-Mail Address*
+
Specifies the email address for accessing Outlook.
*** *Refresh Token*
+
Specifies the refresh token generated with the authentication properties.
+
Learn how to xref:rpa-builder::toolbox-variable-handling-credentials-for-oauth.adoc#generating-an-oauth-refresh-token[generate an OAuth refresh token with RPA Builder].
** *User Account Credentials*
+
Use this credential to access all other types of applications. Fill in the username and password.
. Click *OK*.

== Check the Usage of a Credential

Before editing a credential, check its usage to avoid inadvertent side effects. You can check the usage of a credential only if you belong to the <<form-create-credential-useraffiliation, affiliated users>> of that credential.

To check the usage of a credential:

. Open the *Credential Pool* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click *Usage* (image:usage-icon.png[binoculars symbol,1.5%,1.5%]) in the row of the credential to check.

A window with a table shows you the configurations that use the credential.

==  Edit a Credential

Edit a credential to change its data. You cannot change the type of a credential. You can edit a credential only if you belong to the <<form-create-credential-useraffiliation, affiliated users>> of that credential.

Check the usage of the credential first to avoid inadvertent side effects:

. Open the *Credential Pool* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click *Edit* (image:edit-icon.png[pen-to-paper symbol,1.5%,1.5%]) in the row of the credential to edit.
. Change data in the *Edit the Credential* form.
+
For an explanation of the properties, see <<form-create-credential, *Create a Credential*>>.
. Click *Save*.

The credential is changed everywhere it is used.

== Delete a Credential

Delete credentials that are no longer needed. You cannot delete credentials linked in configurations. You can only delete a credential if you belong to the <<form-create-credential-useraffiliation, affiliated users>> of that credential.

To delete a credential:

. Open the *Credential Pool* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click *Delete* (image:delete-icon.png[trash symbol,1.5%,1.5%]) in the row of the credential to delete.
. Confirm the deletion.
