= Manage Credentials

Credentials store login data for external applications or web services. By using a credential, a bot can log in to an application during process runs. Passwords are encrypted. Only affiliated users can view, edit, and use the credentials.

You can create the following types of credentials:

* *AWS Credentials*
+
For accessing Amazon Web Services to use them with xref:rpa-builder::toolbox-aws-document-processing.adoc[RPA Builder - Document Processing with AWS]
* *OAuth Credentials*
+
For accessing the Microsoft Outlook email application via Microsoft Azure with xref:rpa-builder::toolbox-mail-operations-mail-session-outlook-with-oauth.adoc[RPA Builder - Mail Session (Outlook with OAuth)]
* *User Account Credentials*
+
For accessing all other kinds of applications

Affiliated process team members can link global credentials to activity parameters in automations:

* xref:processautomation-deploy.adoc#test-configuration-link-globals[Linkable Activity Parameters in Test Configurations]
* xref:processautomation-deploy.adoc#production-configuration-link-globals[Linkable Activity Parameters in Production Configurations]

Editing or deleting a credential affects all configurations that use the credential.

Check the usage of a credential before changing or deleting it.

== Before You Begin

* Ask an administrator to xref:usermanagement-manage.adoc#assign-privileges-to-a-user[assign you the needed privileges]:

== Create a Credential

Create credentials with which a bot can log in to an external application during process runs.

Use descriptive names for credentials and only use them in an appropriate context. If, for example, the employee `Nina` has an account for two applications, `Letters` and `Numbers`, create either two credentials (`nina_account_letters` and `nina_account_numbers`) or a single one that includes both applications in its name (`nina_accounts_letters_numbers`).

To create a credential:

. Open the *Credential Pool* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click *Create*.
. [[form-create-credential]] Complete the *Create a New Credential* form:
* [[form-create-credential-useraffiliation]] *User affiliation*
+
Click to choose users that may view, edit, and use the credential. Add yourself so that you can also view, edit, and use the credential.
* *User group affiliation*
+
Click to choose user groups whose users may view, edit, and use the credential.
* *Phase affiliation*
+
Phases in which the credential can be deployed. When you create or change the credential, your privileges determine which phases the user can select:
+
** *Test*
+
The credential can be deployed in the test phase.
+
** *Production*
+
The credential can be deployed in the production phase.

* *Type*
+
Type of the global credential. The type of credential determines where you can use it. The original value defined in RPA Builder is typed. Select one of the following types:
+
** *AWS Credentials*
+
Use this credential for accessing Amazon Web Services. Fill in the client ID, client secret, and region. Using a session token is optional.
** *OAuth Credentials*
+
Use this credential for accessing the Microsoft Outlook email application via Microsoft Azure.
+
*** *OAuth Host*
+
The host address used to get the credentials. The default address for Outlook services is `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/`. This address might change if the customer uses a self hosted service.
*** *Client ID*
+
To authenticate with the OAuth Host, an Azure application must be defined in the customer's space. This Azure application has an ID, which is unique in the entire OAuth Host space, and that allows users to explicitly grant or revoke access for this Azure application to their accounts.
+
For more information about how to create this Azure application for Outlook, see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app[Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform^].
*** *Client Secret*
+
This secret enables RPA Manager to prove to the OAuth Host that it received the permission to access user accounts on behalf of the registered Azure application. Without it, the authentication is not possible.
*** *Redirect URI*
+
The URI to which the OAuth Host redirects after the user completes the authentication attempt. This redirect URI must be registered with the Azure application. The OAuth Host allows the authentication only if the entered redirect URI matches one of the registered URIs.
*** *Scopes*
+
The scopes define which permission the user grants to the Azure application. Grant the following permissions:
+
**** `offline_access`
+
(*Required*) Enables access via a refresh token, which you can use to repeatedly log in to the mail services without requiring user interaction each time.
**** `https://outlook.office.com/IMAP.AccessAsUser.All`
+
(*Required* when using IMAP) Enables reading and moving emails from the Outlook IMAP server.
**** `https://outlook.office.com/POP.AccessAsUser.All`
+
(*Required* when using POP3) Enables reading emails from the Outlook POP3 server.
**** `https://outlook.office.com/SMTP.Send`
+
(*Required* when using SMTP) Enables sending emails from the Outlook SMTP server.
**** `openid email`
+
Enables RPA Manager to automatically detect the email account used to log in to the Azure application. If this scope is omitted, you must provide an email in RPA Builder.
+
*** *E-Mail Address*
+
Email address for accessing Outlook.
*** *Refresh Token*
+
Refresh token generated with the authentication properties.
+
Learn how to xref:rpa-builder::toolbox-variable-handling-credentials-for-oauth.adoc#generating-an-oauth-refresh-token[generate an OAuth refresh token with RPA Builder].
** *User Account Credentials*
+
Use this credential for accessing all other kinds of applications. Fill in the the username and password.
. Click *OK*.

== Check the Usage of a Credential

Before editing a credential, check its usage to avoid inadvertent side-effects. You can only check the usage a credential if you belong to the <<form-create-credential-useraffiliation, affiliated users>> of that credential.

To check the usage of a credential:

. Open the *Credential Pool* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click the *Usage* icon image:usage-icon.png[binoculars symbol,1.5%,1.5%] in the table row of the credential you want to check.

A window with a table shows you the configurations in which the credential is used.

==  Edit a Credential

Edit a credential to change its data. You cannot change the type of a credential. You can only edit a credential if you belong to the <<form-create-credential-useraffiliation, affiliated users>> of that credential.

Check the usage of the credential first to avoid inadvertent side-effects:

. Open the *Credential Pool* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click the *Edit* icon image:edit-icon.png[pen-to-square symbol,1.5%,1.5%] in the table row of the credential you want to edit.
. Change data in the *Edit the Credential* form.
+
For an explanation of the properties, see <<form-create-credential, *Create a Credential*>>.
. Click *Save*.

The credential is changed everywhere it is used.

== Delete a Credential

Delete credentials that are no longer needed. You cannot delete credentials linked in configurations. You can only delete a credential if you belong to the <<form-create-credential-useraffiliation, affiliated users>> of that credential.

To delete a credential:

. Open the *Credential Pool* view of the *Process Automation* module.
. Click the *Delete* icon image:delete-icon.png[trash symbol,1.5%,1.5%] in the table row of the credential you want to delete.
. Confirm the deletion.
