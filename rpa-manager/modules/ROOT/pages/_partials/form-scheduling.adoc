** *From*:
+
Start of the time interval. As of this time, the scheduled action is executed.
The start time must not be in the past and it must not be later than the end time.
Even if you specify a Repeat on a specific day of the week or month that does not correspond to the start time, the schedule is started at this time anyway. The day specified under Repeat is then taken into account from the first repetition onward.
** *To*:
+
End of the time interval. As of this time, the scheduled action is no longer executed.
The end time must not be earlier than the start time.
If you use the Repeat option, the duration of the time interval is defined by the difference between the From and To times.
** *All day*:
+
Select the checkbox *All day* to execute the action throughout the day.
It then begins on the first day at 12:00 midnight and stops being executed at 12:00 midnight of the next day (in the case of one-day intervals) or at 12:00 midnight on the day after the last day (in the case of multi-day intervals).
** *Repeat*:
+
Select the checkbox *Repeat* if the selected time interval is to be used repeatedly.
+
Then, under *Repeats*, you can choose whether the *From-To* time interval is to be repeated every minute, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly.
+
The duration of the contained time interval and the start time are taken into account. The duration of the time interval is defined as the difference between the *From* and *To* times. The *From* time is the start time of the first execution. The start time of repetitions depends on the other set values.
+
If you want to execute the repeats only with reference to the time of day, you should ensure that the start and end date are identical. If the interval specified  covers multiple days, a new multi-day interval begins with every repetition. This can lead to a situation whereby the scheduled time interval lasts longer than expected because the full number of days contained in the *From-To* interval is executed once again during the last repetition.
+
With schedules that are not all day, the actions in each repetition are executed for the duration of the interval specified in *From* and *To*.

*** *Repeat minutely*:
+
If you select *Repeat minutely*, the planned action is executed every minute during the interval specified via *To* and *From*.
+
You can select whether you want to repeat the action every minute or only every _n_-th minute. _n_ here stands for any integer number between 1 and 59.
*** *Repeat hourly*:
+
If you select *Repeat hourly*, the planned action is executed hourly during the interval specified via *To* and *From*. You can select whether you want to repeat the action every hour or only every _n_-th hour. _n_ here stands for any integer number between 1 and 23.
*** *Repeat daily*:
+
If you select *Repeat daily*, the planned action is executed daily during the interval specified via *To* and *From*.
+
You can select whether you want to repeat the action every day or only every _n_-th day. _n_ here stands for any integer number between 1 and 31.
*** *Repeat weekly*:
+
If you select Repeat weekly, the planned action is executed weekly during the interval specified via *To* and *From*.
+
You can select whether you want to repeat the action every week or only every _n_-th week. _n_ here stands for any integer number between 1 and 52.
+
You can also select the weekday on which the scheduled action is to be executed.
*** *Repeat monthly*:
+
If you select Repeat monthly, the planned action is executed monthly during the interval specified via *To* and *From*.
+
You can select whether you want to repeat the action every month or only every _n_-th month. _n_ here stands for any integer number between 1 and 12.
+
You can also choose whether the repeat refers to the day of the month or the day of the week.
+
If the selected day is the last day of a month, you can also choose whether the execution day is always the last day of a month, as the number of days in each month is different.
+
If the selected day is the fourth such weekday of a month, you can also choose whether the execution day is always the fourth or last such weekday of a month, as the number of weeks in each month is different.
*** *Repeat yearly*:
+
If you select *Repeat yearly*, the planned action is executed annually during the interval specified via *To* and *From*.
+
You can select whether you want to repeat the action every year or only every _n_-th year. _n_ here stands for any integer number between 1 and 20.
** *Ends*:
+
If you select *Never* under Ends, the time period is repeated over and over.
+
If you select *After n occurrences* under *Ends*, the time period is repeated _n_ times. _n_ here stands for any integer number between 1 and 100.
+
If you select *Ends on <date>*, the time interval is no longer repeated after this date.
