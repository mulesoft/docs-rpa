= MuleSoft Robotic Process Automation (RPA)

//overview, what is ?
//automates manual processes, earns time, solves repetitive tasks
MuleSoft Robotic Process Automation (RPA) enables you to automate business processes and tasks by using bots, which helps save time and prevent introducing human errors.

//bot can interact and open applications, extract data, manipulate the computer input, faster than humans.
MuleSoft RPA can automate processes that require human input and also interact with systems where an API is not available for consumption. RPA bots can interact with applications, extract data, read images, and manipulate computer input faster and more accurately than humans.

Before creating an automation, Evaluate the process using RPA Manager to assess if it is suitable for automation based on specific properties. During this phase you also determine the cost savings and benefits of automation.

If the process qualifies for automation, you can start Designing the process model in RPA Manager using the Business Process Model Notation (BPMN).

Then, you use RPA Builder to Build the process by filling the individual elements of the model with specific instructions for humans and bots.

After you finish building the process, you start Testing whether the process runs correctly and produces the expected result.

When all test cases complete successfully, you are ready to Deploy the process.

Finally, you can Monitor the status and performance of your deployed processes.

Each deployed process can be scaled, reviewed and changed at any time.

== Use Cases

Your company can benefit in many ways by implementing RPA into their processes, either by saving time, reducing costs, or preventing errors caused by human input.

The most common use cases for RPA include:

Data Extraction and Data Entry
+
Extract data from PDF,CSV, and other file formats and send this data to other systems.
Payroll Processing
+
Automate payroll data entry and validate the information across multiple systems.
Price Comparisons
+
Automate the monitoring of input prices and competitor prices.
Processing Refunds
+
Automate the processing of customer refund requests to make them quicker and provide the best experience for customers.
Customer Information Updates
+
Update customer information automatically across different systems that do not have an API and are accessible only through the UI.

== RPA Lifecycle

MuleSoft provides a complete solution to manage the RPA development lifecycle, which includes the following phases:

Evaluation
+
In this phase you use the Process Evaluation module in RPA Manager to determine if a business process qualifies to be automated by evaluating the costs and benefits of building the automation based on the processâ€™s complexity, stability, and other key values.
Design
+
After the evaluation is complete, you start designing the workflow of the automation which specifies the actions to perform and under which conditions. RPA Manager uses the Business Process Model Notation (BPMN) to create the workflows. You can design the workflow manually by using the drag and drop tools in RPA Manager, or automatically by using the RPA Recorder.
Build
+
The build phase is where you fill the previously created process with instructions and functions. With RPA Builder you can import a BPMN generated in RPA Manager, and then drag and drop operations or record key inputs to specify the action steps. When you finish building the process, you upload it to RPA Manager.
Test
+
During the test phase you create different testing scenarios for your automation projects to confirm that they work as expected. This phase works as the quality assurance step of the development process, you can create real world test scenarios using different parameters and troubleshoot failed steps when there are errors.
Deployment
+
When the automation project successfully completes the testing phase, you are ready to deploy. In the deployment phase, you use RPA Manager to set up the production parameter values, configure the process execution schedule, and select the RPA bots to run the process. You can deploy one automation process to one or multiple RPA bots.
Monitor
+
Finally, RPA Manager provides different management and monitoring options for your deployed automations. You can monitor the performance of the deployed automations, configure alerts and notifications when there is an issue, and locate the source of these issues.
== RPA Manager

RPA Manager is the cloud-based control plane for the automations. RPA Manager is integrated into Anypoint Platform and enables you to:

Manage user access and permissions
Evaluate the viability and financial benefits of implementing an automation
Design and document RPA processes
Test and deploy automations
Manage and monitor deployed automations

== RPA Builder

RPA Builder is the on-premise application that enables you to build the automations by specifying the steps of the process. With RPA Builder you can download and upload automation assets to RPA Manager, add the automation logic to the processes, and also run local tests for the automations.



== RPA Recorder

RPA Recorder is an on-premise tool that assists during the process building phase by automatically recording actions steps from your local environment. RPA Recorder is able to capture keyboard and mouse input, and also open applications and execute operating system tasks.

== RPA Bot


RPA Bots are software robots that run in an on-premise environment and execute the assigned automations. You can manage bots from RPA Manager.
