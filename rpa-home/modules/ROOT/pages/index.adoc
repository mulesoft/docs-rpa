= MuleSoft Robotic Process Automation (RPA)

MuleSoft Robotic Process Automation (RPA) enables you to automate business processes and tasks by using bots, which helps save time and prevent introducing human errors.

MuleSoft RPA can automate processes that require human input and can also interact with systems that do not have an API available for consumption. RPA bots can interact with applications, extract data, read images, and manipulate computer input faster and more accurately than humans.

== Use Cases

Your company can benefit in many ways by implementing RPA into their processes, either by saving time, reducing costs, or preventing errors caused by human input.

The most common use cases for RPA include:

* Data Extraction and Data Entry
+
Extract data from PDF, CSV, and other file formats and send this data to other systems.
* Payroll Processing
+
Automate payroll data entry and validate the information across multiple systems.
* Price Comparisons
+
Automate the monitoring of input prices and competitor prices.
* Processing Refunds
+
Automate the processing of customer refund requests to make them quicker and provide the best experience for customers.
* Customer Information Updates
+
Update customer information automatically across different systems that do not have an API and that are accessible only through the UI.

== RPA Lifecycle

MuleSoft provides a complete solution to manage the RPA development lifecycle, which includes the following phases:

* Evaluation
+
In this phase you use the Process Evaluation module in RPA Manager to determine if a business process qualifies to be automated by evaluating the costs savings and benefits of building the automation based on the processâ€™s complexity, stability, and other key values.
* Design
+
If the evaluation is complete and the process qualifies for automation, you can start designing the workflow of the automation that specifies the actions to perform and the conditions under which to perform those actions. RPA Manager uses the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) to create the workflows. You can design the workflow manually by using the drag and drop tools in RPA Manager, or automatically by using the RPA Recorder.
* Build
+
In the build phase, you fill the previously-created process with specific instructions for humans and bots. With RPA Builder you can import a BPMN diagram generated in RPA Manager, and then drag and drop operations or record key inputs to specify the action steps. When you finish building the process, you upload it to RPA Manager.
* Test
+
During the test phase, you create different testing scenarios for your automation projects to confirm that they work as expected. This phase works as the quality assurance step of the development process. In this phase, you can create real-world test scenarios using different parameters and can troubleshoot failed steps when there are errors.
* Deployment
+
When the automation project successfully completes the testing phase, you are ready to deploy. In the deployment phase, you use RPA Manager to set up the production parameter values, configure the process execution schedule, and select the RPA bots to run the process. You can deploy one automation process to one or multiple RPA bots.
* Monitor
+
RPA Manager provides different management and monitoring options for your deployed automations. You can monitor the performance of the deployed automations, configure alerts and notifications when there are issues, and locate the source of these issues.

== RPA Applications

MuleSoft RPA provides the following applications that enable you to manage the complete development lifecycle of your automation projects:
