= Step 5: Build the Automation From the BPMN diagram

Now that the BPMN diagram for the process to automate is ready, it's time to use RPA Builder to specify each of the actions the RPA bot executes when it runs this process. Because you used RPA Recorder to create the diagram, each existing task already contains the action steps for the bot to execute. During this step, you add a new task to confirm that the sign-up process was successful by reading the confirmation text on the screen.

Before you start defining the actions, configure RPA Builder to connect with your RPA Manager repository so you can import the designs and re-upload them after the build phase is finished.

== Step 5.1: Connect to the RPA Manager Repository

To connect RPA Builder with your RPA Manager repository:

. Open RPA Builder
. In the top menu bar, go to *Options* > *Repository*.
. Provide the required information:
** *RPA Manager Address:* The URL of the RPA Manager instance you want to connect to
+
For example: myorganization.rpa.mulesoft.com.
** *User Name:* Your RPA Manager account user name
** *Password:* Your RPA Manager account password
. Click *Test Connection*
** If the test fails, ensure the provided information is correct and try again
** If the test succeeds, click *OK* to close the message
. Click *OK*

== Step 5.2: Import the Project From the RPA Manager Repository

To import the project from the RPA Manager repository:

. In RPA Builder, click the *Repository Explorer* panel.
+
If this panel is not visible, go to the top menu bar and click *View* > *Show Repository Explorer*.
. Find your project in the *Repository Explorer* and double-click it.

== Step 5.3: Edit the Project and Add an Action Step

To add a new action step into your automation project:

. In RPA Builder, drag the *Create bot task* element from the BPMN editor into your process flow, after the *Sign-up to newsletter* task.
. In the new task element, Write `Confirm sign-up`.
+

. Double-click the *Confirm sign-up* task to open the workflow in edit mode.
. In the *Workflow Initialization* section, double-click *Activity Parameters*.

. Double-click the *generatedWebSession1* parameter to move it to the *Used in this Workflow* session.
+ Alternatively, you can use the arrow buttons to move this parameter.
. Click *OK*.
. Click the *Toolbox* panel.
+
If this panel is not visible, in the top menu bar, go to *View* > *Show Toolbox*.
. From the *Web Automation* section, drag a *Web Session(Chrome)* element into the *Activity Workflow* section.
+
If you have a different web browser configured as the default, ensure that you use the corresponding *Web session* element that matches your default browser.
. Double-click the *Web Session* element you just added in the *Activity Workflow*.
. In *Reuse Web Session*, click the *Web Session id* drop-down menu and select *Activity Parameters* > *generatedWebSession1*.
+

. Click *OK*.
. In the *Toolbox* panel, search for the *Text Recognition (OCR)* section and drag an *Intelligent OCR(2020)* element to the *Web Session* inside the *Activity Workflow*.
+

. Double-click the *Intelligent OC (2020)* element.
. In *Search Mode*, select *Text Comparison*.
. In *Search Text*, write `Thanks for signing up for the newsletter`.
. Click *OK*.
. In the top menu bar, click *File* > *Save Project*.

After you add the text recognition task and save the project, click the *Run Process* (image:run-process.png[The Run process icon,1.5%,1.5%]) button in the BPMN editor to test the complete process and confirm that it works as expected.

== Step 5.5: Upload the Project to RPA Manager

To upload the updated automation project to RPA Manager:

. In RPA Builder, go to *File* > *Upload Project*.
. Provide a description in the *Changes:* field and click *Upload*.
. Confirm that the upload was successful and click *OK*
. Close RPA Builder.

== Next Steps

Youâ€™ve modified the automation project, added a new task to the process, and verified that the automated process works as expected. Now, it is time to create a test plan in RPA Manager and execute the tests for this project.
