= Step 4. Design the BPMN Diagram for the Automation

After creating a new automation project, you can start designing the BPMN diagram for the process to automate. You can create the diagram manually or by using the RPA Recorder, which records your actions, creates each corresponding step in the diagram, and generates the action steps based on your mouse and keyboard interactions.

== Step 4.1: Open the Project for Editing and Start RPA Recorder

Follow these steps to edit your process BPMN diagram using RPA Recorder:

. In RPA Manager, click the *My RPA* module.
. Click *My Backlog*.
. Search for the *MuleSoft newsletter sign-up* project in the process list and click the *Open process* (image:open-process.png[The open process icon,1.5%,1.5%]) button.
. In the *Automation* panel, click the *Record BPMN* (image:record-process.png[The record process icon,1.5%,1.5%]) button.
+
If you see a pop-up window asking for permission, select the checkbox to allow RPA Manager to open RPA Recorder and click *Open*.
. Provide your RPA Manager user account password and click *Login*.

== Step 4.2: Record Activity Steps with RPA Recorder

After you log in to RPA Recorder, you can start the activity recording process. In this process, you alternate between adding activity steps in RPA Recorder and performing the actual actions in your computer that you want to record and include in the BPMN diagram. This procedure continues until you perform the last action and finish the recording.

To record actions with RPA Recorder and create the BPMN diagram, follow these steps:

. In RPA Recorder, click the *Start Recording* (image:start-recording.png[The start recording icon,1.5%,1.5%]) button and add the first activity step:
.. In the *activity name* field, write `Open newsletter sign-up page`.
.. In the drop down menu, select *Web task*.
.. Click *Add*.
.. In the browser session that opens, navigate to the +https://www.mulesoft.com/sign-up+ URL.
. In the RPA Recorder panel, click the *Add activity* (image:add-activity.png[The add activity icon,1.5%,1.5%]) button and add a new activity step:
+

+
.. Write `Sign-up for newsletter` in the activity name field.
.. In the drop down menu, select *Web task*.
.. Select the *Continue with already existing web session* checkbox.
.. Click *Add*
.. In the sign-up page, provide an email address of your choice and click the accept (>) button.
. In the RPA Recorder panel, click the *Stop recording* (image:stop-recording.png[The stop recording icon,1.5%,1.5%]) button.
. Confirm that RPA Recorder generates a BPMN diagram as follows:

After you finish the recording process, upload the newly-created BPMN diagram to RPA Manager.

== Step 4.3: Upload the BPMN Diagram to RPA Manager

Follow these steps to upload the BPMN diagram created with RPA Recorder to RPA Manager:

. In *RPA Recorder*, click the *Edit, Merge and Upload Recordings* (image:edit.png["The edit, merge and upload icon",1.5%,1.5%]) button.
. In the *Automation* panel, click the *Save* (image:save.png[The save icon,1.5%,1.5%]) button.
. Write `MuleSoft Newsletter` in the *Process name* field and click *Save*.
. Click the *Upload to server* (image:upload-to-server.png[The upload to server icon,1.5%,1.5%]) button.
. In the confirmation window that shows after the upload finishes successfully, Click *OK*.
. Close the *RPA Recording Editor* window.
. Close the *RPA Recorder* window.
. Return to RPA Manager and refresh the browser page.
. Click *Publish*.
. Click the confirmation checkbox and then click *Release to Build*.

== Next Steps

Now that you've created a BPMN diagram for your automation project and published it, it's time to move to the build phase, in which you can edit the diagram and specify the actions to execute for each action step.
