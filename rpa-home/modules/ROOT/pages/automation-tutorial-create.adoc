= Step 3. Create the Automation Project

After evaluating and approving a process for automation, create an automation project from the approved process proposal and assign it a category. You can either use a category that exists in your organization or you can create a new one.

== Step 3.1: Create a Category

To create a category, follow these steps:

. In RPA Manager, click the *Process Automation* module.
. Click *Process Management*.
. Click *Create*.
. In the *Name* field, write `Web Automations`.
. Click *OK*.

== Step 3.2: Create the Automation Project

After you create a category, follow these steps to create your automation project:

. In RPA Manager, click the *My RPA* module.
. Click *My Backlog*.
. Search for the *MuleSoft newsletter sign-up* project in the process list and click the *Start automation* (image:start-automation-icon.png[The approve icon,1.5%,1.5%]) button.
. Provide the necessary information for the project:
** In *Process name*, write `MuleSoft newsletter sign-up`.
** In *Category*, select the *Web Automations* category, created in the previous step.
** Disable *Use Process Board*.
. Click *Save*

Now that you've created an automation project, it's time to move to the design phase, in which you create the BPMN diagram for the process.
