// == What's New
include::partial$release-notes/rn-headings.adoc[tag=whatsNew,leveloffset=+1]

* The *Retake* option now displays as a button in a dropdown. Using the *Retake* option, you can delay the screen freeze for capturing image-based mouse clicks. This assists with preparing collapsible menus and hidden elements before the screen capture freeze. User and mouse actions are not recorded during the delay.
* You can now set the initial screen freeze delay directly from the image-based mouse clicks toolbar.
* When recording a Web Task, the selected area now shows a red border.
* RPA Recorder now always generates an `RPARecorder` subfolder during installation. 
* RPA Recorder now uses TLSv1.3 by default, and HTTP is now disabled for all API requests. 
* When recording in Notepad++, long window titles and name attributes are now truncated in the Documentation section of the RPA Recording Editor. 
* Updated the UI of the Settings and Log files panels, as well as the Manual Activity and Comment dialogs.

== Other Important Changes

* The attribute selection panel is no longer enabled and cannot be expanded or collapsed when recording image-based mouse clicks in a Web Task. Once image-based mouse clicks recording is finished, the panel can be opened.
* Upon completion of recording image-based mouse clicks for a Web or Bot Task, a message now appears to indicate recording has been resumed.
* When recording image-based mouse clicks in a Web Task, the browser window cannot be minimized, and the address bar and buttons are no longer enabled in the browser window.
