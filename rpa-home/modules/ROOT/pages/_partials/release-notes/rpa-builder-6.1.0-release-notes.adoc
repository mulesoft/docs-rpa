include::partial$release-notes/rn-headings.adoc[tag=whatsNew,leveloffset=+1]

* The new Mail Session (Outlook with OAuth) Action Step enables you to establish a connection to a mail server using MS Outlook and authenticate using OAuth to perform mail operations such as reading, sending, and changing emails.
* The new Credentials for OAuth Action Step enables you to generate OAuth credentials at runtime and reuse them within other Action Steps in the Workflow.
* The Combine String Action Step now supports 20 substrings as inbound variables.
* The Tables with AWS and Key values with AWS Action Steps now include a `Confidence` attribute in the JSON output.
* The Generate and Modify Date and Time Action Step outputs three new variables to allow easier comparison between dates:
** *Elapsed days*: Contains the days elapsed from 01/01/01 at 00:00 to the defined date at 00:00. The result is in whole days.
** *Elapsed hours*: Contains the hours elapsed from 01/01/01 at 00:00 to the defined date and hour (Xh:00min). The result is in whole days and hours.
** *Elapsed minutes*: Contains the minutes elapsed from 01/01/01 at 00:00 to the defined date, hour and minutes (Xh:XXmin). The result is in whole days, hours, and minutes.
* The new OAuth Credentials activity parameter enables you handle OAuth credentials across multiple activities of a process.
* You can now generate OAuth tokens using the *Tools* > *Generate OAuth Refresh Token* option in the menu bar.
* The *Use All Users as project home location* option in Settings now reads *Save Projects and Settings in All Users Folder* for better clarity.
