* You can now start RPA Recorder from RPA Builder via the Activity Workflow or by clicking the new *Record* option in the xref:rpa-builder::workbench-toolbar-overview.adoc[Workbench Toolbar].

* The documentation in the Process Recording Editor is redesigned to improve the appearance and readability.
* Layout and styling changes are made to the user interface of the Process Recording Editor.
* When starting RPA Recorder from RPA Manager, you can now install the latest RPA Recorder version from the RPA Recorder home page. An *Update Available* button shows on the home page whenever a new version is available.
* You can now use the ESC key on your keyboard to cancel or close dialogs and pop-up messages in RPA Recorder.
