* The documentation in the Process Recording Editor has been redesigned to improve the appearance and readability.
* Layout and styling changes have been made to the user interface of the Process Recording Editor.
* When starting RPA Recorder from RPA Manager, you can now download and install the latest RPA Recorder version by clicking *Update Available* on the RPA Recorder home page.
