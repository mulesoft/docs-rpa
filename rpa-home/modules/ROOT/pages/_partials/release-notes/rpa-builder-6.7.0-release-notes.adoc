== Migrating OAuth Credentials

As part of the enhancement to Mail Session (OAuth) and the OAuth Credentials activity parameter, RPA Builder 6.7.0 automatically detects and updates any existing OAuth Credentials and removes all existing mappings of this activity parameter. RPA Builder appends `_updated` to migrated activity parameters. 

If your automation projects used OAuth Credentials, follow these steps after upgrading to RPA Builder 6.7.0 to complete the migration process: 

. In RPA Builder, locate the updated OAuth Credentials activity parameters.
. Add the updated activity parameters to the corresponding workflows and map them to the corresponding Mail Session (OAuth) action steps.
. In RPA Manager, create a new OAuth Credential global variable in the credential pool. 
. Map the new global variable with the updated OAuth Credentials activity parameters in the corresponding run configurations.
