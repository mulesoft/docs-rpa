// == What's New
include::partial$release-notes/rn-headings.adoc[tag=whatsNew,leveloffset=+1]

* The script now provides the Bot GUID when executing a workflow so that the Bot GUID can be provided via runtime variable in RPA Builder.
* The *Check interval* option is now constrained to a range between 1 and 15 seconds. If you currently have the option set to a value higher than 15 seconds, then the value will be reset to 15 seconds upon release of this enhancement.
* Added a new *System Settings* panel to the RPA Bot Configurator. This panel provides options to configure basic settings on the host computer.
* Extended the logging system information by adding `key`, `type`, and `name` registry values.
* Removed the *Test Settings* button from the Session Settings panel.
* Created a command-line test tool that is similar to FreeRdp but uses the MuleSoft `rpa-freerdp-2.10.dll`.
* Added an `x-correlation-id` header to all traffic passing ingress to incoming user/customer/tenant API requests.
