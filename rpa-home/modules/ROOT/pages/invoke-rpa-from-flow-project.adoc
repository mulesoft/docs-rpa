# Create an Automation Project

Create an automation project first. An automation project consists of the process, its requirements, the team that is responsible for the automation, and the implementation. 

## Before You Begin

* Use a meaningful name for your automation project to quickly find your invocable action in Salesforce Flow.
* Use Secure Sessions to enable your process to run in parallel.
