= List of Privileges by Module

RPA Manager has the following privileges, which can be assigned to individual users.

To open any module, you always require the privilege for which the name ends in *Open*.

Privileges that end with *Administration* authorize a user to create, change, and delete all types of objects in the corresponding module.
If the authorization only applies to a single type of object in a module, the corresponding privileges end with  *Create*, *Edit*, and *Delete*.

Privileges named *Global <...> View* authorize a user to see all the processes in the relevant view. A user who does not have this privilege can only see processes for which they belong to the project team.

If you assign a role to a user, the user receives all the privileges contained in the role. These privileges are not displayed in the *Privileges* field in the user's profile.
