# Publish an RPA Process to Salesforce

An RPA process is published to Salesforce as an invocable run configuration. Each project can contain one invocable run configuration, which can be used in various other products.

The name of the project, with spaces removed, is contained in the names of the following Salesforce objects:

* Named Credentials 
* External Credentials
* External Services
* MuleSoft Services
* Invocable Actions
* Resources

For example, if your project is named `My Super Process`, the corresponding Salesforce object is named `MySuperProcess10'.

The initial values for the Activity Parameters are set in RPA Manager and can be overwritten in Salesforce Flow.
