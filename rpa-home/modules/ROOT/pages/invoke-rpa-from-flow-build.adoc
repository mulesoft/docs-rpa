Implement your automation in RPA Builder.

## Before You Begin

* For input and output parameters of a process, only use variable types that are supported in Salesforce Invocable Actions as RPA Builder Activity Parameters:

* Use meaningful names to quickly find your input and output resources in Salesforce Flow.
+
* To implement Salesforce naming standards, adhere to the following rules:
** Use camel case.
** Use only the characters `a-z`, `A-Z` and `0-9`.
** Restrict the length of the names to 255 characters.
