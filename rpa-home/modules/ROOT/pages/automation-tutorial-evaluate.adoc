= Step 2. Evaluate a Process for Automation

Before you start designing a process for automation, think about the following questions:

* What processes are there in your company?
* Who is responsible for the processes?
* Which criteria are necessary and suitable to evaluate the processes?
* How can these criteria be described clearly and comprehensively?
* Where does the data for evaluating the processes come from?
* Which systems and data are needed to automate the processes?

After gathering this information, you can use the default evaluation template or create your own evaluation criteria and templates to assess the feasibility and benefits of automating a process.

== Step 2.1: Create an Evaluation Criterion

Create a new evaluation criterion to use during the process evaluation:

. Open RPA Manager.
. Click the *Process Evaluation* module.
. Click *Evaluation Criteria*.
. Click *Create Benefit*.
** In the *Name* field, write: `Concurrency`
** Click the *Exclude* checkbox
** In the *Definition Gradation 1* field, write: `Yes, allows parallel executions`
** In the *Definition Gradation 2* field, write: `No, only one execution at a time`
. Click *Save*.

== Step 2.2: Create an Evaluation Template

After you create new criteria for evaluation, create a new evaluation template that includes that criteria:

. In RPA Manager, Click the *Process Evaluation* module.
. Click *Evaluation Templates*.
. Click *Create*.
** In the *Name* field, write: `My custom template`
** Scroll down and verify that the *Exclude muleSoft default evaluation criteria* checkbox is unselected
** Inside the *Available qualifiers* section, click the *Move All* (->->) button
** Inside the *Available benefits* section, click the *Move All* (->->) button
+
Note that the *Concurrency* criterion created in the previous step appears in this section.
. Click *Save*.

== Step 2.3: Create a Process Evaluation

When creating a process evaluation, you can select the default evaluation template or a custom template you created.

To create a new process evaluation using the custom template created in the previous step:

. In RPA Manager, Click the *Process Evaluation* module.
. Click *Process Evaluation*.
** In the *Name* field, write: `MuleSoft newsletter sign-up`
** Click the *Template* dropdown and select *My custom template*
. Click *OK*.

After confirming these details, you are redirected to the evaluation view where you specify the *Costs*, *Qualifiers* and *Benefits* for this process:

. Set the *Manual process execution time* field to `00:10:00`.
. In the *Benefits* section, set the *Concurrency* slider to *No, only one execution at a time*.
. Click *Save*.

== Step 2.4: Submit the Process to Start an Automation Project

After you finish evaluating a process for automation and confirm that it is suitable, submit the process to the next step to start an automation project:

. In RPA Manager, Click the *Process Evaluation* module.
. Click *Process Evaluation*.
. Search for the *MuleSoft newsletter sign-up* project in the process list and click the *Approve* (image:approve-icon.png[The approve icon,1.5%,1.5%]) button.
. In the window that opens, enable the *Project Manager* option.
. In the *Project Manager* dropdown menu, select your username.
. Click *OK*.

== Next Steps

After the process evaluation finishes and the process is approved, the assigned Project Manager or Center of Excellence can start the automation project.
