= Glossary

The following glossary helps you understand MuleSoft terminology.



== A

''''''
=== Activity

A basic unit of work in the Mule application flow. This can in turn be a connector that connects to an external system or a transform step that is used to transform data inside the application.

=== Automation Credits

To be defined.


== B

''''''

=== Bot tasks

Bot tasks contain the activities for the RPA bot to execute.

=== BPMN

Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a standard specification for diagrams to depict business processes. Such diagrams can be created directly by the process owner and easily translated into a machine-executable program.

=== BPMN editor

An editor that is available both inside RPA Manager and RPA builder to modify existing BPMNs.


== C

''''''
=== Center of Excellence (CoE)

If the users of a user group cover the entire range of competencies required for a specific part of the automation, the group is called a _Center of Excellence (CoE)_. Only user groups explicitly designated as Centers of Excellence can accept process automation tasks.

=== Composer Tasks

A measurement unit that reflects any action that a Composer Connector executes, including, but not limited to: read, create, update, and delete actions. See the xref:https://www.mulesoft.com/prod-subscription-plans[MuleSoft Product Subscription Plans^] for additional details.


== D

''''''

== E

''''''

== F

''''''

== G

''''''

== H

''''''

== I

''''''

=== Invocable API

To be defined.

=== Invocable/Invokable (process/production/run) configuration

To be defined.


== J

''''''

== K

''''''

== L

''''''

== M

''''''
=== ((business) process) model

To be defined.

=== MuleSoft Automation

MuleSoft Automation enables you to automate workflows that contain time-consuming manual tasks and integrate them with your MuleSoft Composer flows.


== N

''''''

== O

''''''

=== OCR

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) enables you to convert images, or printed text into machine-encoded text.

=== Organization

The container for everything in your RPA Platform account.

== P

''''''

=== Process candidate

A real-life business process about to be proposed for automation via process evaluation.

=== Process owner

To be defined.

=== Project Manager

A project manager is responsible for the automation of a process across all automation phases.

== Q

''''''

== R

''''''
=== RPA

MuleSoft Robotic Process Automation (RPA) enables you to automate business processes and tasks by using bots, which helps save time and prevent introducing human errors.

=== RPA Bot

RPA bots are software robots that run in an on-premise environment and execute the assigned automations. You can manage bots from RPA Manager.

=== RPA API Call

A measurement unit used to calculate Automation Credits usage based on outbound REST API Calls that are made from an RPA Process. See the xref:https://www.mulesoft.com/prod-subscription-plans[MuleSoft Product Subscription Plans^] for additional details.

=== RPA Bot Minute

A measurement unit used to calculate Automation Credits usage based on RPA executions. See the xref:https://www.mulesoft.com/prod-subscription-plans[MuleSoft Product Subscription Plans^] for additional details.

=== RPA Builder

RPA Builder is the on-premise application that enables you to build the automations by specifying the steps of the process.

=== RPA Manager

RPA Manager is the cloud-based control plane for the automations that is integrated into Anypoint Platform.

=== RPA Recorder

RPA Recorder is an on-premise tool that assists during the process building phase by automatically recording action steps from your local environment.


== S

''''''
=== Secure session

Secure Session is a hidden Windows session that runs invisibly and closed in a separate user account. The screen does not show what is happening or what information is being processed.


== T

''''''

== U

''''''
=== User tasks

User tasks are elements of a process model, which cannot be processed fully automatically by a Robot, instead requiring the support of a human.


== V

''''''

== W
