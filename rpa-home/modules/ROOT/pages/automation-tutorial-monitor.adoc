= Step 9: Monitor the Automation

After publishing the process and executing it from Composer, use the Process Monitoring module to see a summary of the deployed bots and the process executions.

== Step 9.1: See a Live Stream of the Deployed Process

To see a live stream of the deployed process:

. In Composer, open the flow you created in step 8 for editing and click *Test*. 
. Switch to RPA Manager and open the *Process Monitoring* module.
. Click on *Process Streaming*.
. Refresh the page and click *Show process streams*. 
+
If the button is disabled and shows *No sessions running*, it means the process has not started yet. In that case, refresh the page and try again. 
. Click *On* to enable showing screen captures of this process.

The *Process Streaming* section shows a window for each run configuration that is currently executing. The stream consists of a sequence of images that the RPA bot records during process execution.

[TIP]
If this section shows empty, it is possible that the execution of the process has already finished, meaning that it is not running now and it cannot provide a stream of the process.

== Step 9.2: Monitor the Deployed Process

To see the active bots and the deployed processes:

. In RPA Manager, open the *Process Monitoring* module.
. Click on *Bot State and Operation*.

The *Bot State and Operation* section shows a list of your configured bots and the current process executions.

Note that the *Work done* column shows *1*, which confirms that the execution of the process finished one time.

== Next Steps 

At this point you finished creating a Composer Flow that calls an automated process that you previously created and published using MuleSoft RPA. 

You can use this project as a template or starting point to develop further automation projects and integrations between MuleSoft Composer and RPA.
