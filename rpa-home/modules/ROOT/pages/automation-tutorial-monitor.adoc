= Step 8: Manage and Monitor the Automation

After deploying the process, use the Process Monitoring module to see a summary of the deployed RPA bots and the process executions.

== Step 8.1: See a Live Stream of the Deployed Process

To see a live stream of the deployed process:

. In RPA Manager, open the *Process Monitoring* module.
. Click on *Process Streaming*.
+
The stream consists of a sequence of images that the RPA bot records during process execution.

+
* The *Process Streaming* section shows a window for each run configuration that is currently executing.
* The *On* button enables screen captures of the process the bot is carrying out.

[TIP]
If this section shows empty, it is possible that the execution of the process has already finished, meaning that it is not running now and it cannot provide a stream of the process.

== Step 8.2: Monitor the Deployed Process

To see the active bots and the deployed processes:

. In RPA Manager, open the *Process Monitoring* module.
. Click on *Bot State and Operation*.

+
* The *Bot State and Operation* section shows a list of your configured bots and the current process executions.
* Note that the *Work done* column shows *1*, which confirms that the execution of the process finished one time.

== Step 8.3: Revoke the Deployed Process

After monitoring the process, follow these steps to revoke the deployment:

. In RPA Manager, open the *My RPA* module.
. Click *My Processes*.
. Click *MuleSoft newsletter sign-up*.
. In the *Production configurations* panel, click the *Select action* drop-down menu.
. Click *Revoke process*.
. Select your run configuration and click *Execute*.
