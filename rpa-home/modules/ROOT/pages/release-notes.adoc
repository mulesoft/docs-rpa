= RPA Release Notes

RPA Manager instances automatically update to the latest version available; you donâ€™t need to perform any tasks to move to the new version.

The latest versions of RPA Builder, RPA Recorder, and RPA Bot become available for download in RPA Manager as soon as they are released and you must manually update them on your local environment.
