MuleSoft adds all the RPA execution times in seconds for the period and converts the total into minutes with two decimal precision. MuleSoft reports Automation Credits with two decimal precision.

For example, if you run 5 processes that take 30 seconds each to execute: MuleSoft converts the total execution time (150 seconds) to minutes, rounds up the last two digits: 150/60 = 2.5 minutes, and then converts the minutes to Automation Credits and rounds up the last two digits: 2.5/2 = 1.25 credits.
