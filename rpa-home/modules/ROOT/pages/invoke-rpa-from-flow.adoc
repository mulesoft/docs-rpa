# Invoke RPA Processes from Salesforce Flow

You can run RPA processes as part of a Salesforce Flow by following these steps:

. Create an automation project.
. Build your process in RPA Builder.
. Publish an invocable run configuration to Salesforce in RPA Manager.
. Call the Invocable Actions from Salesforce Flow.

## Before You Begin

* If you use the <Old Automation Bundle>, refer to the following documentation:
** https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?language=en_US&id=sf.flow_build_use_flows_with_mulesoft_rpa.htm&type=5 for establishing the trust relationship between your MuleSoft and your Salesforce organizations.
** https://docs.mulesoft.com/rpa-manager/processautomation-deploy#publish-automation-exchange for creating and publishing an invocable run configuration.
* If you use the <New Automation Bundle>, refer to this documentation.

## Create an Automation Project

An automation project consists of the process, its requirements and the team that is responsible for the automation.

### Before You Begin

* Use a meaningful name for your automation project to quickly find your invocable action in Salesforce Flow.
* Use Secure Sessions to enable your process to run in parallel.

Refer to https://docs.mulesoft.com/rpa-home/create-rpa-project to learn more about creating automation projects.

## Build an Automation

Implement your automation in RPA Builder.

### Before you Begin

* Name your Activity Parameters wisely:
** Use meaningful names to quickly find your input and output resources in Salesforce Flow.
** Use CamelCase and restrict the length of the names to 255 characters to implement Salesforce standard.

Refer to https://docs.mulesoft.com/rpa-manager/processautomation-develop#build-a-process to learn about building processes.

## Publish an RPA process to Salesforce

An RPA process is published to Salesforce as an invocable run configuration. Each project can contain one invocable run configuration, which can be used in other products.

The name of the project, with spaces removed, is contained in the names of the following Salesforce objects:
* External Services
* Mulesoft Services
* Invocable Actions
* Resources

The initial values for the Activity Parameters are set in RPA Manager and can be overwritten in Salesforce Flow.
