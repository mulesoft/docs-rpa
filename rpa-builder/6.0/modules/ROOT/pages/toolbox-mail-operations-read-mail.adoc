= Read Mail

With the _Read Mail_ Action Step, you can read the e-mails from a
mailbox. You can easily restrict the results using the filter function,
which simplifies the search.

The _Read Mail_ Action Step works similarly to the Excel Controlled Loop
and bundles other Action Steps, with which you can further process the
e-mails you have found.

The Read Mail Action Step makes the entire content of an e-mail
available to you as individual outbound variables.

You can only use the Read Mail Action Step within a Mail Session. You
enter the information required for the connection to the mail server in
the Mail Session.

The following filter functions are available:

* Body
* Mail info
* Read/ Unread
* Recipient (To:)
* Recipient (Cc:)
* Sender
* Subject
* Text Search

== Properties

*Read Mail Settings*

*Attachment folder path* Path to the folder in which the attachments of the e-mails are saved.

*Body* Text to be contained in the body of the e-mail.

*Create attachment folder* If a checkmark is set here, a folder is
created if it did not already exist. In this folder, the attachments
from the e-mails are saved.

*Folder name* Name for the folder that is specified in the Read Mail Action Step under _Inbox Folder Name_.

You should ensure that the folder really exists in the mailbox you
specified in the Mail Session.

If you have selected the IMAP protocol in the Mail Session and you wish
to call up a subfolder of the inbox, you must always specify the
complete path under Folder Name, e.g. Inbox/Servicetrace/Alerts.

If the folder _Servicetrace_ is on the same level as the _Inbox_, then
Servicetrace/Alerts would be sufficient as the path name.

Irrespective of whether you are using a German or English version of
Outlook, with IMAP, the path must always begin with Inbox and must *not*
begin with "Posteingang".

POP3, however, does not support the folder structure in the inbox so you
cannot specify a folder there.

*Mail info* The ID of a specific e-mail that originates from a different Read Mail Action Step and can be
incorporated here as an inbound variable.

*Maximum emails to read* Displays the number of e-mails to be read. You can read up to 99 e-mails.

*Read* Only those e-mails that have already been read are displayed.

*Recipient (Cc:)* The recipient address is sought in the Cc.

*Recipient (To:)* The recipient address is sought.

*Save attachments* If the checkbox is selected, the attachments of the
e-mails that were found are saved in the specified folder. A separate
folder is generated for each e-mail. The path to this subfolder is
available as an outbound variable.

*Sender* The entered text is to be contained in the sender address.

*Sort mode* (Default: Newest first) Specifies the order in which the
found e-mails are sorted. You can choose between Newest first and Oldest
first.

*Subject* Here, the text is sought only in the subject of the e-mail.

*Text search* This text is sought in the entire e-mail.

*Unread* Only unread e-mails are displayed.
