== Text Recognition (OCR)

=== AI OCR (file-based)

The _AI OCR (file-based)_ Action Step is a further development of the
existing OCR Action Steps. In contrast to the other OCR Action Steps, it
is based on concepts of neural networks. The available languages,
therefore, are based on trained patterns that take account of the
characteristics of the relevant language. In many cases, therefore, the
correct recognition of texts that are, for example, barely legible or
have little contrast or an unusual font, is improved with this Action
Step.

Using the _AI OCR (file-based)_ Action Step, existing images such as
document scans can be recognized.

The basis for this Action Step is an image file. This can be available
in the regular graphic formats such as BMP, JPEG, PNG and TIFF.

You should consider the Intelligent OCR 2020 Action Step if more than
one language is to be recognized at once or if you wish to use your own
dictionary.

In the following Chapter, we will look at the key differences compared
to the Action Step Legacy OCR. You can find a detailed description of
properties, variables, etc. in the Chapter entitled
link:#OCR_TextRecognition[_Text Recognition – Legacy OCR_.]

==== Properties

*OCR Image Preprocessing*

[arabic]
. *Force Black Background* Reverses the color of the screenshots. This
is especially recommended for white text on a black background.
. *Scaling factor* Displays the selected enlargement in the wizard.
. *Remove Shadows* If there are uneven shadows on the image, you can
remove them with this option.
. *Noise Filter* If there are disruptive pixels (image noise) in the
image, you can suppress them with this option.
. *Enhance Contrast* If an image has low contrast and is very pale as a
result, you can use this option to increase the contrast.
. *Color Depth* The digitalization of an image consists of two steps,
rasterization and quantization. Rasterization refers to breaking down
the image into small pieces. An original dot becomes a pixel. In the
case of scanned templates, due to the low resolution of the scanner, not
all original dots are converted. A reduction in resolution takes place.
In quantization, it is determined which value is assigned to a pixel. If
we only distinguish between black and white, we get a binary image. Each
pixel is stored as one bit, we refer to 1-bit color depth. Typically, an
image has a resolution (or color depth) of 8 bits. If there are several
levels of brightness, we refer to grayscale values. Every other value
that differs from 1 bit reduces the image to a lower grayscale value.
This way, it is often possible to remove disruptive image artifacts,
which simplifies processing with OCR. We recommend a value of 3 or 4.

*Bypass processing pipeline* With this option, you can completely
deactivate image processing. The settings made in the wizard are not
taken into consideration.

*OCR Settings*

*Area mode* Appears as soon as you define the search area under Scan
Area. You can choose between:

* {blank}
+
____
*Actual Pixels* The image is used in its original resolution
____
* {blank}
+
____
*Fit to DIN A4* The original image is enlarged in height or width until
it corresponds to the aspect ratio of a DIN A4 sheet. Depending on
whether height or width is adjusted, there are areas that are augmented.
The original resolution of the image remains intact.
____
* {blank}
+
____
*Fit to DIN A3* Behaves as with DIN A4. Since DIN A4 and A5 have an
identical aspect ratio, there is currently no difference. However, in
the future, new algorithms are likely to have to take account of the
size. Therefore, this selection is now available.
____

[#AS_AIOCRfilebased_P_ImageFileName .anchor]####**Image file name** Name
of the image file.

[#AS_AIOCRfilebased_P_ImageFolderPath .anchor]####**Image folder path**
The path to the folder in which the image file is located.

*Orientation* If you selected _Fit to A4_ or _A3_ in Area mode, you can
select the format.

* {blank}
+
____
*Automatic*
____
* {blank}
+
____
*Landscape*
____
* {blank}
+
____
*Portrait*
____

==== Inbound Variables

link:#AS_AIOCRfilebased_P_ImageFileName[*Image file name*]

link:#AS_AIOCRfilebased_P_ImageFolderPath[*Image folder path*]

==== Outbound Variables

*IsSucceeded* (Boolean) Indicates whether text recognition has been
carried out successfully or not.

==== Wizard

You can use *OCR Image Preprocessing* to improve the quality of the
image so that the OCR operation can run optimally. This is always
carried out in the specified sequence. Here, you can also switch the
individual steps on or off.

If you click on *Load design-time file*, the Windows Explorer opens and
you can select a sample file. You can start a test run with the *Test
button*. For a local Workflow run or the subsequent productive process
run, the Directory Path and file name must be entered correctly. The
sample image selected for the test run is no longer considered in this
case.

Under Directory path, you define the path to the new file to be created.
You can create an absolute path or a path relative to the _Base Path_
using the buttons image:media\image1.png[image,width=141,height=17] and
image:media\image2.png[image,width=108,height=18]. You select an
existing path using the button
image:media\image3.png[image,width=18,height=18]. To construct the path,
you can also insert variables from the Workflow. To do this, click on
the pin image:media\image4.png[image,width=17,height=24]and select one
of the variables available.

If an image file has been selected and you click on *Scan Area*, the
following wizard opens

image:media\image5.png[image,width=355,height=340]

Here, you can also define the settings for image processing.
