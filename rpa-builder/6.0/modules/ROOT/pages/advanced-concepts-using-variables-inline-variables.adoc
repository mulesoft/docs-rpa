== Inline Variables

Inline variables allow you to use any variable directly in a text field
in combination with other text and variables. This option is available
in most text field properties, but not in all. Names, for example,
cannot use inline variables. To use an inline variable, simply reference
it as follows:

*+#var#+=$Variable_Name;*

For example, to use the variable "Hostname", you can enter
_++#var#++_=$Hostname; in any text field to insert the variable. To insert
variables created in other _Action Steps_, you will typically find a
drop-down list.


Another notation for inline variables is to enclose them in curly
brackets like this: _\{$Variable_Name}_

You can also use the +#var#+ notation with all _AutoIT_/_ServiceTracer®
Client_ _3_ functions, as documented in the additional _Help_ files

Example usage: *+#var#+=TimerInit();*
