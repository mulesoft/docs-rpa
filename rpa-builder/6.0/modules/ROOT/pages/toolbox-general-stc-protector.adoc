When creating a _Workflow_ that needs to run stably and robustly for
long periods, pop-up windows can be difficult to handle. Mostly they
appear irregularly, so it is not easy to implement them into a static
_Workflow_.

To handle these pop-ups, you can use _STC Protector_. Think of it as a
process running parallel to your actual measurement _Workflow_, checking
if any window appears onscreen, and then closing it in an instant by
sending a predefined keystroke sequence.

== Properties

* *Pause between keystrokes, ms* Define how long _the Robot_ should
pause between each keystroke sequence
* *Use regular expression for window title* You can further distinguish
between window titles by selecting this checkbox. For a short
introduction to regular expressions, refer to Chapter
xref:advanced-concepts-using-regular-expressions.adoc[Using Regular Expressions].
* *Use window text* Defines if, in addition to the window title, window
text should also be used to identify the window that the keystrokes
should be sent to
* *Window check type* Sets whether the protector reacts if a window
merely exists or if it has to be active to be handled by _STC
Protector._

== Wizard

Click _Start_ to begin recording the keystroke sequence for handling
pop-up windows. Select the pop-up window with the mouse and press the
combination of keys needed to close it. When you are finished, click
_Stop_. A new line for this window will appear in the _STC Protector_
wizard.

The pop-up windows are identified by the window title. Make sure only
one line exists for each window title!

You can also add pop-up windows that are not actually onscreen. Use the
*+* button and enter the window title and the combination of keys needed
to close it.

Some applications open pop-up windows that have the exact same title as
the main application. In this case, the _STC Protector_ cannot decide
which window should be handled by means of the title alone. To avoid
this problem activate _Use window text_ before clicking _Start_. Now
_STC Protector_ will use text displayed in the window and not only its
title to decide whether it is a pop-up window to be closed.

You can also distinguish between window titles by using the checkbox
_Use regular expression for window title_. This function is described in
detail in Section xref:advanced-concepts-using-regular-expressions.adoc[Using Regular Expressions].

== Example

When there is more than one tab opened in _Internet Explorer_, the
program asks you if they should all be closed when you wish to exit the
application. This question is displayed in a pop-up window.
//image:media\image1.png[image,width=604,height=338]
////
When recorded with the _STC Protector_ using window text in addition to
the window title you will get this:

image:media\image2.png[Ein Bild, das Text enth√§lt. Automatischgenerierte Beschreibung,width=378,height=302]
////
Now, during execution, when the pop-up window appears, the _STC Protector_ will automatically send the *_Enter_* keystroke to it and
thus close the window.

To ensure that the window is closed as quickly as possible (to avoid any
interference with the measurement), leave the _Pause between keystrokes_
setting at "0".

== Troubleshooting

In extremely rare cases, the _Workflow_ seems to stop and do nothing
more after a pop-up window has been handled. This might be the case when
the window is not actually closed by the given keystroke sequence, but
the main application hides it completely from the desktop without
removing the window handle from the operating system. In such cases, try
setting _Window Check type_ to _Active_.
