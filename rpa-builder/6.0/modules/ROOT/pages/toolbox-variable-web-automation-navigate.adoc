This _Web Automation_ object allows you to perform navigation
operations, such as going backwards or forward in the navigation history
or refreshing the current webpage. It can also be used to call a
specific URL.

== Properties

*Navigation Command* Decide if the current webpage should be refreshed.
Use this to go backwards or forwards in the browsing history or if you
want to load a specific URL.

*Navigate to this URL* If you have selected _Specify a URL to navigate to_ under _Navigation
Command_, then enter the URL to be loaded here.

== Inbound Variables

//link:#AS_Naviagte_P_NavigateToThisURL[*Navigate to this URL*]
*Navigate to this URL* If you have selected _Specify a URL to navigate to_ under _Navigation
Command_, then enter the URL to be loaded here.

== Outbound Variables

The Action Step _Navigate_ possesses no outbound variables.

Please note:

When calling a specific page using the _Navigate_ Action Step, it is
important to note that the initial page build may take longer than the
execution of the Action Step itself. The page request often loads only a
very small, initial HTML page. Therefore, while the page is being loaded
for the user, the NavigateTo has long been completed.

The only help here is an appropriate anchor point. This can be done in
WebAutomation, using a _Check Element_ that waits until the elements
appear in the completely displayed page. A _PatternSearch_ could also be
used at this juncture. You can use this anchor point as a stable
starting point for subsequent actions.

== Example

Measurement of the initial page load is particularly relevant in
connection with APM/TA. This is only possible if you can enclose the
transaction in a stopwatch clause. Since this is not possible directly
in a web session, the web session is often opened with a neutral page
(about:blank). Within the block, you might now expect that a stopwatch
and the NavigateTo it contains will return the requested value from the
page to be measured. This is usually not the case, however, because the
page request often only load a very small, initial HTML page. In turn,
this page loads further page content asynchronously, which then creates
the actual visual page. Therefore, while the page is being loaded for
the user, the NavigateTo has long been completed, which means the
measured time does not correspond to the time actually required by the
page.
