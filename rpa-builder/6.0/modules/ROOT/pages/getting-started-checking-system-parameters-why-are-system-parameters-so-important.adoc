== Checking System Parameters

=== Why Are System Parameters So Important?

Some system parameters in _Microsoft Windows®_ significantly affect how
the screen image is displayed. For example, turning _ClearType_ (a font
smoothing algorithm built into _Microsoft Windows®_) on or off affects
the rendering of almost all displayed text – this includes browsers,
applications, system dialogs, menu bars, etc.

As you can see, there
is a big difference between the display of text when _ClearType_ is on
or off. Our image search algorithm always compares a "_Pattern image_"
to what is visible on the screen during execution. Now imagine you
capture a _Pattern image_ containing text on a system where _ClearType_
is enabled (i.e. the left part of the picture above), but then execute
the _Workflow_ on a system where _ClearType_ is disabled. The
_MuleSoft_ image search algorithm compares the left-hand image to
the right-hand one and, although it still finds the image, the match
precision will be very low.

Aside from _ClearType_, the image search is also affected by the "Menu
drop shadow" setting and the DPI setting.

The display parameters on the system used to create a _Workflow_ should
always be identical to the parameters on the system where the workflow
is executed!

You should also turn off any settings or programs that may disrupt the
_Workflow_ during execution due to unexpected behavior, such as
displaying sudden pop-up windows. Common causes of sudden W__orkflow__
failures are automatic updates to _Windows_ and other programs you have
installed.

You should always configure your agent systems to show no unexpected
behavior such as sudden pop-ups, screensavers, or similar.

==== The Recommended Systems Settings Are:

* Disable screen saver
* Turn off all power option properties
* Disable automatic _Windows_ updates
* Disable _ClearType_
* Disable menu drop shadow effects
* Set desktop scaling to _100%_

==== Checking the System Parameters

The menu item _View_ -> _Show System Parameters_ opens an overview over
the most important settings of your system.

Settings marked with a green circle can be left this way.

Settings marked with a red circle should be changed.

With the button Refresh you can check if setting changes have led to an optimization of the status.
