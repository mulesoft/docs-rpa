== Read from Text File

The _Read from Text File_ Action Step allows you to read from a text
file and you use the _Read_ _Mode_ to specify which part of the file is
to be read. The button in the Workflow shows the _Read Mode_ that is
presently active in brackets after the name of the Action Step (in the
example above: WholeFile). There is an option to determine whether the
text should be deleted after reading.

To achieve a correct result, the text file to be read has to be UTF-8
encoded.

=== Properties

*File Operation Settings:*

* *Delete line(s) after read* Specify whether the text should be deleted
after it is read.
* *Directory path*
Enter the path to the directory where the file to be read is stored. You
can specify an absolute or relative path. If a relative path is used,
then the path relates to the _Base Path_ variable.
* *File name* Enter the
name here of the file that is to be read.
* *Line count* Enter the number of lines to be read. This option can be
used if you have specified that more than one line (_Range of lines_)
should be read in _Read file check mode_.
* *Number of first or Single Line* Specify the number of lines that are
to be read here. If you have selected more than one line to be read in
_Read file check mode_, i.e. a _Range of lines_, this is where you
select the line number at which to start reading.

The first line in a text file is line number 1!

* *Read file check mode* Use _Read file_ _check mode_ to specify which
part of the file is to be read:
** *Read whole file* The whole file will be read.
** *Last line* Only the last, most recent line of the file will be read.
** *Single line* Only a single line will be read (please also note the
setting *Number of first or single line*).
** *Range of lines* A set of lines will be read (please also note the
setting *Number of first or single line*).
* *Read to end* Specify whether to read to the end of the file. This
option can be used if you have specified that more than one line (_Range
of lines_) should be read in _Read file check mode_. The advantage of
this option compared to the _Line count_ option is that you do not have
to define how many lines are to be read when in _Range of lines_ mode.

Other Properties that are the same in all Action Steps are described in
the section on *Common Properties*. For reasons of
clarity they are not shown here.

=== Inbound Variables

*Directory path*
Enter the path to the directory where the file to be read is stored. You
can specify an absolute or relative path. If a relative path is used,
then the path relates to the _Base Path_ variable.

*Directory path*
Enter the path to the directory where the file to be read is stored. You
can specify an absolute or relative path. If a relative path is used,
then the path relates to the _Base Path_ variable.

=== Outbound Variables

*Read text* The _Read from Text File.Read text_ variable provides the
selected read mode (_Read file check mode_).

*IsRead* The _Read from Text File.IsRead_ variable indicates whether the
file could be read or not (True/False).

*Line Count*  The _Read from Text File.Line Count_ variable provides the
number of lines that are to be read.

*File name* The _Read from Text File.File Name_ variable provides the
name of the file that is to be read.

*Directory path* The _Read from Text File.Directory Path_ variable
provides the path that is used.

=== Wizard

* *Directory path* Specify the path to the file that is to be read. You
can create an absolute path or a path relative to the _Base Path_.
// using the image:media\image1.png[image,width=175,height=22] and
//image:media\image2.png[image,width=129,height=22] buttons.
The initial
value is %STWS_BASEPATH%. Select an existing path.
// using the image:media\image3.png[image,width=20,height=20] button.
You can also
insert variables from the _Workflow_ in order to construct the path. To
do so, click on the pin and select one of the available variables.

More information about the environment variables (Insert Environment
Variable) and script variables (Insert Script Variable) can be found in
the section *Settings*.

* *File name* Enter the name here of the file that is to be read. You
can also insert a variable from the Workflow as the _File Name_. To do
so, click on the pin and select one of the available variables.
* *Read mode* Use _Read_ _mode_ to specify which part of the file is to
be read. Other fields will be shown depending on the chosen setting:
** *Entire file* The whole file will be read.
** *Last line* Only the last, most recent line of the file will be read.
** *Single line* Only a single line will be read. Enter the line number
of the line that is to be read in the *Line Number* field.
** *Range of lines* A range of lines will be read. Enter the line number
of the first line that is to be read in the *First line to read* field.
Enter the number of lines that is to be read in the *Line count* field.
Use the option *Read to end of file* to specify that reading is to occur
until the end of the file. The advantage of this option compared to the
_Line count_ detail is that you do not have to define the number of
lines that is to be read.

The first line in a text file is line number 1!

* *Remove line(s) after read* Specify here whether the text should be
deleted after it is read.
