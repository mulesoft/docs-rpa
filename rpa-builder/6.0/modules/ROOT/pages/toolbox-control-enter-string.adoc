= Enter String

Like the _Keystrokes_ Action Step, the _Enter String_ Action Step
emulates keyboard inputs. You can use this to enter search criteria or a
URL in the browser address bar, for example. You can also use it to
execute hotkeys or macros.

The text to be entered can be transferred to the _Enter String_ Action
Step from a previously executed Action Step.

== Properties

*Input String Settings*

**Input string**
(string, default blank, cannot be left blank, mapping possible) String
to be entered via the emulated keyboard.


*Keyboard Settings*

* *Initial pause* (integer, ms, default 500 ms, minimum value 0 ms)
Pause before emulation of the string input begins.
* *Key down delay* (default 5 ms, maximum 1000 ms) Duration in ms for
which a key or combination of keys is held down. The input will be
executed at the start of this delay.
* *Key up delay* (default 5 ms, maximum 1000 ms) Duration in ms for
which a key or combination of keys is released.

*Window Settings*

* *Use a regular expression for window title* If this option is active,
the string entered in the _Window Title_ field will be interpreted as a
regular expression (see also the section on
xref:advanced-concepts-using-regular-expressions.adoc[Using Regular Expressions]).
* **Window title** Title of the window where the keyboard inputs are to be executed.

== Inbound Variables

*Input string*

*Window title*

== Outbound Variables

The _Enter String_ Action Step possesses no Outbound Variables.

== Wizard

*Input String Settings*

The Input String can be supplemented by Insert Variables.

*Window Handling Timing*

You have the option to specify the title of the window where the string
is to be entered under Window Title.

If you click on the Collect Window Titles button you can then select a title from the drop-down list of all the
windows which are presently open. To open them click the mouse on the
arrow symbol at the right-hand side of the input window.

The _Window title_ can also be described using a regular expression. For this, please
select the check box to _Use a regular expression for window title_.

Please make sure for extended input sequences that the _Key up delay_ is
set for long enough to send the keyboard inputs to the correct window.

There is a visual explaining Keyboard Settings in the section on Keystrokes.

== Enter String or Keystrokes?

If you need the _window text_ to specify the input window or want to
record the text that is to be entered directly via the keyboard, please
use the _Keystrokes_ Action Step.

In all other cases, and in particular if the text for inputting is to be
transferred by means of a Pin Variable, please use the _Enter String_
Action Step.
