== Keystrokes

Like the _Enter String_ Action Step, the _Keystrokes_ Action Step
emulates keyboard inputs. You can use this to enter search criteria or a
URL in the browser address bar, for example. You can also use it to
execute hotkeys or macros.


=== Properties

*Keyboard Settings*

* *Key Down delay* (default 5 ms, maximum 1000 ms) Duration in ms
specifying how long it takes for a key or combination of keys to be
pressed down. The keyboard input is generated at the start of this time
period.
* *Key Up Delay* (default 5 ms, maximum 1000 ms) Duration in ms
specifying how long it takes for a key or combination of keys to be
released.
* *Pause (ms)/Pause between keystrokes, ms* (default 500 ms) Pause
between two input sequences. An input sequence starts with a pause.

For a better understanding, please also see the example at the end of this sub-section.


*Window Settings*

* *Common window title* If the checkbox _Use common window title for all
keystrokes_ is activated, the window title used to identify the window
that keystrokes are sent to is displayed here
* *Use common window title for all keystrokes* Select if all the
keystrokes should be performed in the same window
* *Use RegEx/Use a regular expression for window title* You can further
distinguish between window titles by selecting this checkbox. For a
short introduction to regular expressions, refer to Section
Using Regular Expressions
* *Use window text* Defines if, in addition to the window title, window
text should also be used to identify the window that the keystrokes
should be sent to

=== Wizard

* *Start* Starts the recording of keystrokes
* *Stop* Stops the recording of keystrokes
* *Raw* Records all keys as they are pressed. This also includes all
modifier keys like *S__hift__*. Pressing the *_Shift_* key and *a*
records the following key press sequence: "\{SHIFTDOWN}a\{SHIFTUP}".
* *Norm* Records characters as they would appear in an editor like
_Notepad_. Here, pressing the *_Shift_* key and *_a_* records a capital
*_A_*
* *Move* *keystroke* *sequence* Moves the selected keystroke sequence up
or down
* *Add keystroke* Calls the _Keystrokes Editor_ where you are able to
enter a keystroke sequence manually. For more information about the
_Keystrokes Editor_ see further down in this section.
* *Edit keystroke sequence* Reconfigures an existing
keystroke sequence manually with the _Keystrokes Editor_
* *Delete* Deletes the selected keystroke sequence from the list
* *Clear* Deletes all keystrokes within the _Action Step_
* *Hide window when start* Hides the wizard window when _Start_ is
clicked (if you are using this option, you need to press *_F10_* to stop
the capture)
* *Hide main window when start* Hides the RPA Builder window when
_Start_ is clicked
* *List of keystrokes* All the keystrokes defined for this _Action Step_
are listed here
* *Use window text* Defines if, in addition to the window title, window
text should also be used to identify the window that the keystrokes
should be sent to
* *Use a regular expression for window title* You can further
distinguish between window titles by selecting this checkbox. For a
short introduction to regular expressions, refer to Section
Using Regular Expressions.
* *Use a common window title for all keystrokes* Selects if all
keystrokes should be performed in the same window
* *Collect Window Titles* Collects all titles of all windows that are
currently opened; you may select the required title from a drop-down
list provided by this function
* *Pause (ms)/Pause between keystrokes, ms* (default 500 ms) Pause
between two input sequences. An input sequence starts with a pause.
* *Key Down delay* (default 5 ms, maximum 1000 ms) Duration in ms
specifying how long it takes for a key or combination of keys to be
pressed down. The keyboard input is generated at the start of this time
period.
* *Key Up Delay* (default 5 ms, maximum 1000 ms) Duration in ms
specifying how long it takes for a key or combination of keys to be
released.

You can either manually add a keystroke sequence by clicking the plus button, which will open the
_Keystrokes Editor_ (see further details below) or you can record
keystrokes.

Start the recording by clicking the start button. Each keystroke you now
perform will be recorded. If you pause for around five seconds between
two keystrokes, the following ones will be recorded as a new keystroke
sequence. This means they will be recorded on a new line with a new ID
in the _Keystrokes wizard_ and the _Pause between keystrokes_ delay will
be performed before them during playback.

Stop the recording by clicking the stop button. A keystroke
sequence can be edited using the edit button or by
double-clicking it. If you want to remove a single keystroke
click X, if you want to
clear the whole keystroke sequence click the clear button.

Optionally, a window title can be specified for each keystroke and the
pause time between the keystroke sequences can be altered. Error
handling is configured as usual.

Click the plus button to open the _Keystrokes Editor_.


Here you can type a keystroke sequence into the _Keystroke_ field or you
can paste into it from the clipboard. You can also use content from the
drop-down menus _Insert special character_ (special characters e.g.
*_Alt_*, *_Caps Lock_*, *_Esc_*, or the number pad keys) and _Insert
Macro_ (complete macros, e.g. to close a window, select all elements,
etc.).

You can also use inline variable (see Section Inline Variables) by clicking _Insert script
variable_ or by typing them as needed. It is also possible to use _Login
Data_ defined within the _Workflow_. Simply use the inline variables
\{$User0} and \{$Password0} and replace the 0 by the number of the login
data item you want to use here.

Finally, you can select and use any defined environment variable for a
_Keystroke_ _Action Step_ by using the corresponding drop-down menu.

If you want to type into an application that was started with
administrator privileges, RPA Builder has to be started with
administrator privileges too. Otherwise the key strokes are lost and
won’t be displayed.

If a _Workflow_ run stops at the point a keystroke should be performed
and immediately indicates that an error has occurred, check if the
common window title setting is correct. If you are not able to set a
common window title that works, you can leave this field empty as a
workaround.

=== Delay and Pause Example

image::toolbox-control-keystrokes-image1.png[Keystroke wizard]

image::toolbox-control-keystrokes-image2.png[Example] The delay times will
be applied differently depending on the keyboard inputs.

Each sequence starts with a pause.

In the example shown above, the _Alt_ and _TAB_ keys are pressed
simultaneously. That is why there is only one _Key Up_ and one _Key Down
Delay_.

The next keys are pressed separately and therefore each have their own
_Delays_.

Because _MuleSoft_ starts with a capital _M_, which involves the
keystrokes _SHIFT_ + _m_ , this _M_ has two _Delays_.

Again, the next keys are pressed separately and therefore each have
their own _Delay_ values.
