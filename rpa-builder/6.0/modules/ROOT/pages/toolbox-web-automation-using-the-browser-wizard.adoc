= Using the Browser Wizard

The _Browser Wizard_ is part of _Web Automation Action Step_ wizards. It behaves like a normal browser and enables you to select additional elements of a website and determine their _Xpath_. Using the _Browser Wizard_ is required by most _Web Automation_ objects embedded in a _Web Session._

Clicking the *Open Browser Wizard* button in one of the wizards opens a new
window that functions as a browser and loads the URL that is defined as the
initial URL for the enclosing _Web Session_.

If you start the _Web Session_ with `about:blank`, you can enter a URL in the address bar of the _Browser Wizard_ and the wizard loads this URL when you press _Enter_.

== Selecting Web Elements

When you position the cursor over the element you want to check or use within a _Web Automation_ object, the wizard highlights the element with a blue background. If moving the mouse over the elements does not highlight them, click on the website or web application within the _Browser Wizard_ to activate it first.

To select the highlighted element press _F2_. After selecting an element, its background turns blue and the _XPath_ and available attributes corresponding to this element show on the Properties panel.

Alternatively, first click the _Auto-Select after 5 Seconds_ button and
then highlight the element by hovering the mouse over it. After five
seconds, the highlighted object is automatically selected.
