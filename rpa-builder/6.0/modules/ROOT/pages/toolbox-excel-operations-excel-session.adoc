== Excel Session

The _Excel Session_ is an element that encompasses all Excel operations.
Excel operations include the reading, modification, and creation of
entire files and file elements in the Excel format.

To use Excel operations it is not necessary to have Microsoft Excel
installed on the computer.

In the Excel Session you define which Excel files should be opened,
where these are located at what time, and how they should be used.

By placing other Action Steps within the _Excel Session_ it is possible
to process the information from the Excel files further.

The Excel files are opened when the _Excel Session_ starts to be
executed and are duly closed again at the end of the session.

An _Excel Session_ may contain a maximum of one further Excel Session.
To optimize computer performance, please never place an Excel Session
inside a loop. If you wish to execute a loop across all the elements in
a row or column in the Excel file, please place the relevant loop within
the Excel Session.

=== Properties

*Destination Excel Operation Settings*

The Destination Excel Operation Settings are only relevant if you have
selected the mode Read from source and write to different file.

* [#AS_ExcelSession_P_CreateDstIfNotExists .anchor]####**Create
destination file** (Bool, default: False) Determines whether the
destination file should be created if it doesn't exist already
* *Destination file name* (string, no default) Name of the destination
file, i.e. the file that will be written
* *Different destination directory path for workflow run* If the option
_Use different destination directory path for workflow run_ is
activated, the alternative destination directory specified here is used
at runtime.
* *Different destination file name for workflow run* If the option _Use
different destination file name for workflow run_ is activated, the
alternative file name is used at runtime.
* [#AS_ExcelSession_P_DirectoryPathDest .anchor]####**Directory Path**
(string, default: %STWS_BASEPATH%)Path to the directory where the
destination file is located

[#AS_ExcelSession_P_FileNameDest .anchor]####Only a single file name is
used for the destination file, regardless of whether a different
directory path is used at the time of execution compared to the time of
design.

* *Sheet name to be added* (string, no default) Name of the sheet that
is to be added to the destination file
* *Use different destination directory path for workflow run* If this
option is activated, an alternative path is used at runtime.
* *Use different destination file name for workflow run* If this option
is activated, an alternative file name is used at runtime.

*Excel Operation Settings*

* [#AS_ExcelSession_P_OperationMode .anchor]####**Operation mode**
(drop-down selection, default: Read only) Type of _Excel Operation_.
There are three different modes available:
** *Read only* The source file is read only and cannot be modified
** *Read and write to the same file* The source file is read and can be
modified
** *Read from source and write to different file* The source file is
read but cannot be modified. Furthermore, a destination file is opened
and this is where changes are made.

[#AS_ExcelSession_P_Source .anchor]####**Source Excel Operation
Settings**

* *Different source directory path for workflow run* (string, no
default) If _Use separate source directory path for Execution_ is
selected, the path specified here will be used as the path to the
directory in which the source file is located.
* *Different source file name for workflow run* If the option _Use
different source file name for workflow run_ is activated, the
alternative file name is used at runtime.
* [#AS_ExcelSession_P_DirectoryPathSource .anchor]####**Directory Path**
(string, default: %STWS_BASEPATH%)Path to the directory where the source
file is located

* [#AS_ExcelSession_P_FileNameSource .anchor]####**Source file name**
(string, no default) Name of the source file. This is the file that is
read – and written to in the mode _Read and write to the same file_

* [#AS_ExcelSession_P_SeparateSourceDirPath .anchor]####**Use different
source directory path for workflow run** (Bool, default: False)
Determines whether a different source directory should be used when
executing the Workflow compared to that at the time of creation.
* *Use different source file name for workflow run* (Bool., default:
False) Determines whether an alternative file name should be used when
running the workflow instead of the draft name.

=== Wizard

In the link:#AS_ExcelSession_P_OperationMode[Operation Mode] section,
first choose whether you want to only read the Excel file, read and
modify it or read it and write to a different Excel file. If the _Read
Only_ mode is selected, the source file is read only and cannot be
modified.

The link:#AS_ExcelSession_P_Source[source file] is the file that should
be read. You can write the path to the directory where the source file
is located directly in the input field, insert Environment and Script
Variables, make a selection using a file explorer
image:media\image1.png[image,width=20,height=20] or connect with a Pin
Variable. You also have the option of using a different file at the time
of execution to at the time of creation. Simply select the checkbox
image:media\image2.png[image,width=303,height=15].

Please note that in this case the file name must be identical. You must
always specify the file extension as well as the file name.

You can use a second file as the
link:#AS_ExcelSession_P_DirectoryPathDest[destination file]. In this
case the source file is read only and cannot be modified. The
destination file is for storing information. If the destination file
does not exist yet, it will be created if you have selected the checkbox
link:#AS_ExcelSession_P_CreateDstIfNotExists[_Create destination file if
it doesn’t exist_].

The options image:media\image3.png[image,width=247,height=20] and
image:media\image4.png[image,width=264,height=17] enable you to use a
dynamic Excel file at runtime for the Excel operations. The *Different
file name* field can be used to specify a separate file for the
execution time directly or map it using a pin variable.
