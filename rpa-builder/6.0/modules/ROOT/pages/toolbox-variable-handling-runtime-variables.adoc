== Run Time Variables

The _RunTime Variables_ Action Step allows variables to be used that are
completed at a _Workflow_'s runtime.

The following variables can be used:

* *Project Name* Name of the _Workflow_ project
* *Project GUID* GUID belonging to the _Workflow_ project
* *Run GUID* GUID relating to executing the _Workflow_ (regenerated for
each run)
* *Time* Actual time as local time or UTC in configurable format
* *Time* Actual date as local time or UTC in configurable format
* *HostName* Name of _Host_ system
* *UserName* Name of the user
* *Random* Positive random number (whole number) with configurable range
of values. A different number is generated each time the workflow runs.

The _Random_ variable is an integer value; all other variables are
string variables.

It is not possible to debug the _RunTime Variables_ Action Step. Debug
functionality for this is therefore switched off in RPA Builder.
This means that it is no longer possible to set a breakpoint for a
_RunTime Variables_ Action Step.

=== Properties

*Write RunTime Variables to Logfile* If this option is enabled, the
RunTime variables are written to the Stc log file.

=== Outbound Variables

*RunTime Variables.[ name of the _RunTime_ variables]* Content of
_RunTime_ variables.

=== Wizard

The _RunTime Variables Action Step_ wizard is used to specify whether
variables are to be made available in all subsequent transactions (_Make
Variables available in all further Transactions_ checkbox). First select
the type of variable you wish to add (_Add new RunTime Variable_ combo
box).

Use the _Delete_ button to remove any variables that are no longer
required.

The values listed under _Sample Data_ in the wizard are used in a local
test. If the _Workflow_ is completed by a _Bot_, the values will
re-determined at each runtime.

Then give a name to the variable to be produced and perform any settings
required using the drop-down _Settings_ menu.
