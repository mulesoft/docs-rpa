The _Get Array Count_ Action Step returns the number of elements in an array.

You can then use this number as the number of iterations in a loop (_Loop_), for example, across the array elements.

An array is either created via the element _Workflow Based Variables_
//link:#WorkflowBasedVariables[_+++Workflow Based Variables+++_]
or returned as the result of the _Read from Excel File_ Action Step.

== Properties

This Action Step contains no special properties other than the _general_ ones.
//link:#CommonProperties[+++general+++]

== Inbound Variables

* *Array to get count of* (array, default: blank) Array for which the
number of elements is to be determined.

This array must be created beforehand using the _Workflow Based Variables_ element or
the Read from Excel File Action Step.

Please note that the return array from the _Read from Excel File_ Action
Step is only shown within the same transaction as a Pin Variable. If you
would like to use the _Array Count_ in a subsequent transaction, please
copy the return array into an array which has previously been created in
the Workflow Based Variables (see _Set_Array_Variable_).

== Outbound Variables

* *Array Count* (integer, default 0) Number of elements in the array

== Wizard

//image:media\image1.png[Ein Bild, das Text enth√§lt. Automatiscgenerierte Beschreibung,width=381,height=226]

All arrays which are available within the Workflow are shown in the drop-down list next to _Array to get count of_.

Please make sure that the array was previously correctly populated. An empty array returns an _Array Count_ of 0.

== Example

In this example, an auto repair shop wants to monitor automatically
which _Services_ have been performed on a certain vehicle.

These services are read from an array and checked off on a checklist.

In order to test the Workflow, the _Workflow Based Variables_ were
populated with sample values. In productive operation these values are
then overwritten with values from the _Car Service App_.

//image:media\image2.png[image,width=774,height=446]

The _Services_ array is populated with all the services from the _Car
Service App_ which are performed.

First, in the transaction _130 Process list of done services_, the
number of services that have been performed is calculated using the _Get
Array Count_ Action Step before each service is read in a loop and
graphically (see _OCR_) compared
against the services on a checklist.

If the service is on the checklist, it will be checked off. The
checklist is used later on in the Workflow to calculate costs.

The configuration values of the individual Action Steps are passed on
using (Pin) _Variables_.
