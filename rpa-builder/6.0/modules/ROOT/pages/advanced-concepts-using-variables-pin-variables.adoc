== Pin Variables

Pin variables are used by creating a mapping between one set of _Action
Step_ properties and another _Action Step_ variable. If this option is
available, a little pin will be shown on the _Action Step_ that can be
mapped to:

In the example above, _Read Clipboard_ provides a variable which can
then be subsequently used by _Ping_. This is indicated by the pin icon
on the right-hand side of the _Ping_ element. Click on the pin to open
the _Edit Variable Mappings_ wizard:

Here you can see a list of all _Ping_ properties that can be mapped to.
Each property has an adjacent drop-down box containing all variables
which can be mapped to the associated property. To map a variable,
simply select it from the drop-down box. The variables which can be
allocated may change depending on the position of the _Action Step_. A
variable can only be allocated to the property "Suffix" within a
configured _File Controlled Loop_. Other variables are limited to one
_Transaction_. This limitation can be overcome using the _Variable_
_Action Step_. When you close the wizard, you will see that there is now
an active mapping, indicated by a black pin:

You can also view a list of all other _Action Steps_ that a particular
_Action Step_ has taken variables from.

To do this, open the context menu for the _Action Step_ of interest by
right-clicking on the _Workbench_, then select the entry _Mapped to
Action Step_. The list will be displayed as a a sub-menu.

Clicking on an element in this sub-menu will take you directly to the
corresponding _Action Step._
