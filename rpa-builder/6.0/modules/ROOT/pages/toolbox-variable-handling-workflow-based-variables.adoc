The _Workflow Based Variables_ Action Step contains variables which can
be used throughout the entire Workflow and which can be modified.

The variables are typed. They may be structured as text
(_alphanumeric_), whole numbers (_integers_) or floats
(_floating_-_point numbers_), Boolean values (_Boolean_) and lists
(_array_).

Use the _Set Variable_ and the _Set Array Variable_ Action Steps to overwrite the
initial variable values with new values at a later point in the Workflow.

The _Workflow Based Variables_ Action Step can only appear once in a
Workflow and must be positioned in the _Workflow Initialization_ section.

== Properties

This Action Step contains no special properties other than the
_common_ ones.

== Inbound Variables

This Action Step possesses no inbound variables.

== Outbound Variables

All _Workflow Based Variables_ are outbound variables.

They are specified in the format Workflow Based Variables.[name of
variables].

In the _Variable Mappings_ for an Action Step only those _Workflow Based
Variables_ of the appropriate type are shown.

The symbols next to the variable names indicate the type.

Action Steps which work with strings will show _Workflow Based
Variables_ of all types except _Array_.

Action Steps which work with arrays internally can also use alphanumeric
variables.

That is why such Action Steps will show array and alphanumeric _Workflow
Based Variables_ to choose from.

(It is possible to populate the elements of an array via a string if
this string contains comma separated values. For more information,
please refer to the section entitled link:#_Set_Array_Variable[_Set
Array Variable_].)

== Wizard

//Click on the image:media\image3.png[image,width=128,height=19] button to
Add a new variable.
//image:media\image4.png[Ein Bild, das Tisch enthält. Automatischgenerierte Beschreibung,width=144,height=149]
Then select the type of variable from the menu.
//image:media\image5.png[Ein Bild, das Text enthält. Automatischgenerierte Beschreibung,width=604,height=328]
You can then enter the name, description, and value of the variables
directly into the relevant fields.

The variable names can be comprised of a combination of letters,
numbers, and underscores.

Special characters and spaces are not permitted.

The variable name must be unique. It must not be used multiple times for
different variables.

The floating point variable will display up to 14 decimal digits. When
entering more than 14 decimal digits the value will be rounded off to
the nearest 14th place.

The elements for array variables must be separated by commas.

The values for array variables are initially saved as strings. That is
why, when saving the Action Step, all array elements which are not yet
presented in double quotes will automatically be placed in double
quotes.

//image:media\image6.jpeg[image,width=604,height=89]

If you want to include an element containing one or more commas in your
list, you must place this element in double quotes before saving it.

E.g. “4,2” or “many commas: ,,,, , , ”

Text elements are permitted to contain single quotes:

E.g. “This ‘text’ contains single quotation marks.”

Text elements which need to contain double quotes must include another
double quotation mark before each double quotation mark and the whole
element also needs to be placed inside double quotes.

E.g. “This “”text”” contains double quotation marks.”

== Example

Car servicing is to be processed automatically at a workshop. For this
purpose the variables required in the Workflow are to be created as
Workflow Based Variables. For testing purposes, they may be
pre-populated with meaningful values.

If all Transactions are active, the Workflow Based Variables in
Transaction 120 are populated with data from the application using the
_Set Variable_ Action Step.

In the example, however, only Transactions 130 and above are intended to
be tested.

Because the variables are not generated first in Transaction 120 and
instead are generally available as Workflow Based Variables,
Transactions 100 – 120 can simply be deactivated and the other parts of
the Workflow work with the initial values.

== Variable or Workflow Based Variables?

The _Workflow Based Variables_ provide a clear overview and a place for
all the variables used within a Workflow.

They are already standardized and, by contrast to the variables in the
_Variable_ Action Step, do not need to be converted to an appropriate
type for use in a different Action Step.

Because they are not first generated within a transaction, any parts of
the Workflow can be _disabled_ or _enabled_ without breaking the mapping
between variables.

The possibility of initially populating the _Workflow Based Variables_
means that different scenarios can be effected deliberately in the
process. This makes it easier to test individual parts of a large
Workflow.

The _Variable_ Action Step is intended to be used if information is
being stored that is only required within a single Transaction and is
then not subsequently needed.
