= Analyzing Problems with Analysis Packages

After the business process runs locally in RPA Builder, you can upload it to RPA Manager, move it to the test phase, run it on an RPA Bot, and start a long-term test. We recommend a test period of three days before using the business process productively. If menu runs contain errors, RPA Manager generates Analysis Packages that you can download.

The Analysis Package provides detailed information on the run in the same format as if you had executed the Workflow locally and also enables you to fix the error. Elements, which have caused an error or a warning, are marked with an expandable red or yellow frame respectively. This frame contains more detailed information concerning the run results. Use the Analysis Packages to understand and fix errors for each failed Workflow run. If you see the same error repeatedly, fix the error once and start collecting results again.

== Download and Analysis Package

To download an Analysis Package for a Workflow that throws an error:

. In RPA Manager, open the *Process Management* module.
. Open the process for which you want to download the Analysis Package.
. Start a test and wait a few minutes for the test to complete.
+
If you don't have any test plans available, click *Create new test plan* and follow the instructions to create one.
. Click *Update* to refresh the test run results.
. Click the result number in the *Failure* column.

If there are no errors, the *Failure* column shows `0` results and there's no Analysis Package available to download.
. Click the *Download* button.

== Load and Analysis Package

To load an Analysis Package:

. In RPA Builder, open any Workflow to make the Workbench menu appear.
. In the Workbench menu, click *Tools*.
. Click *Load Analysis Package* and select the location of the Analysis Package file.

== Analysis Package Directory

RPA Builder creates the `custom` directory after you start the menu locally for the first time, either with the *Run Workflow* button or by pressing _F7_. The path to the `custom` directory is: `C:\Users\[UserName]\Documents\MuleSoft\Cache\[Process-GUID]\[Activity- GUID]\Robot\custom\`.

You can right-click on the Workflow tab and select the *Open Workflow Location* option, which automatically redirects you to the `C:\Users\[UserName]\Documents\MuleSoft\Cache\[Process-GUID]\[Activity- GUID]\` folder.

You can add extra data like screenshots or log files to the analysis package by saving them to the projectâ€™s `custom` folder. RPA Manager packs all files from this folder into the analysis package in case of an error.

Note that when an RPA Bot executes the Workflow, it saves the analysis package on the machine on which the bot is running.
