== Intelligent OCR (2020)

The _Intelligent OCR (2020)_ Action Step represents a good alternative
to the previous OCR (Legacy OCR). The new OCR contains the languages
Arabic, Greek, Hebrew, and Thai.

In the following Chapter, we will look at the key differences compared
to the Action Step Legacy OCR. You can find a detailed description of
the properties, variables, etc. in the Chapter entitled _Text Recognition â€“ Legacy OCR_.

=== Properties

*Color Depth* (bpc) In documents with many images and colors, a setting
with low color depth leads to faster search results. You can select a
value between 0 and 8. Value 0 means that the color depth remains
unchanged compared to the original.

*Enhance Contrast* Adjusts the image contrast so that the legibility of
the text is improved.

*Image Type*

* {blank}
+
____
*Auto* (default) The document type is determined automatically
____
* {blank}
+
____
*Document* Can improve the OCR operation of a document (PDF)
____
* {blank}
+
____
*Snippet* Can improve the OCR operation of selected text sections
____

*Recognition Strategy*

* {blank}
+
____
*Fast* The OCR operation is carried out faster but this can lead to
poorer scan quality
____
* {blank}
+
____
*Advanced* (default) The OCR operation can take longer but the results
are optimal.
____

=== Outbound Variables

The outbound variables are identical to those in the Legacy OCR.

=== Wizard

*Scaling Mode*

*Auto Scale by Engine* (default) Scaling to a higher resolution takes
place automatically if this improves the OCR operation. This can lead to
slightly longer search operations and also requires more main memory.

*Scale by 1* The scaling of the recorded image is set to 1.

*Manual scale* In the _Manual scale_ mode, you can determine the scaling
factor yourself. You can enter an enlargement value of between 1 and 4
in each case. It is *not* recommended to use a high value (4) in
combination with a large image excerpt.

*Dictionary*

In contrast to the situation with Action Step _Legacy OCR,_ here you can
combine the Asian languages with each other, and also with the other
languages.

You can select a maximum of two languages at any time.

*Timing*

*Retries [0..5]* (Default: 3) With this menu option, it is possible to
repeat the search recognition up to 5 times. If the text recognition is
successful, no further attempt is carried out. This option only appears
if you have selected text, RegEx, or fuzzy comparison in search mode.
