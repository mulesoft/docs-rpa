= Running Workflows and Viewing Workflow Run Results

To perform a test run of a Workflow in RPA Builder, click *Run Workflow* (image:run-process.png[The Run Workflow icon, 2%, 2%]) on the Workbench toolbar or press _F7_ on your keyboard.

//This action generates a _.stc3_ script file based on your Workflow and then executes it.
The RPA Builder window is hidden while the Workflow executes, so the engine can now use the mouse and keyboard just like a normal user would and you can watch to confirm if the Workflow performs correctly. Do not use the mouse or keyboard while the Workflow is running.

Depending on the settings you made for the *Show Message boxes* value in the _Project Properties_, additional information may appear during the run. Note that every message box takes a few seconds to disappear, which causes a corresponding pause in the Workflow and affects measured times and Workflow stability.

Before using a Workflow for productive measurement, turn off debug message boxes and perform at least one test run afterward.

== Pause or Exit a Workflow Run

To pause or exit the Workflow during the execution:

. Click the (image:test-script-tray-icon.png[Test script tray button, 2%, 2%]) tray icon.
. Select either *Script Paused* or *Exit*.

Pressing _Pause/Break_ on your keyboard also stops a running Workflow.

== The Workflow Run Results Panel

After you execute a Workflow from within RPA Builder by clicking Run Workflow (image:run-process.png[The Run Workflow icon, 2%, 2%]), information about the last run displays in the Workflow Run Results panel at the end of the RPA Builder screen:

This information helps identify problems and their causes in your Workflow much more quickly. If you do not see the Workflow Run Results window, click *Show Workflow Run Results* in the menu bar.

The Workflow Run Results window lists information about measured response times, found images, errors that occurred, and captured screenshots. You can double-click an entry to navigate to its corresponding Workflow element.

=== Identifying Errors

Workflow elements that failed to execute successfully and caused an error are marked red:

Click on the expander arrows to get more detailed information about the error:

This panel provides detailed information about what failed. In this case, the _Web Session (Firefox)_ Action Step cannot start because it is not installed in the computer that is executing the test run for the Workflow.

In addition, the error screenshot is displayed showing the desktop as it looked when the error occurred. The screenshot can be enlarged by clicking on it.

== Opening the Trace Log

The Trace Log contains even more detailed information about the last run. To open the Trace Log, click *Open Trace Log* in the Tools submenu inside the Workbench toolbar:
