== Image Search

The _Image search_ is a very important _Action Step_. It searches for a
user-defined image, waits until it appears or disappears, and can also
be used as a relative anchor point for mouse clicks. 'Image' in this
sense does not only mean 'picture', but also includes the visual
representation of lettering or control elements like buttons.

The main use cases for the _Image search_ are:

* To compute the loading time of a webpage or an application loading
data from a distant server, it is not sufficient to wait for the window
to appear. In such cases, the webpage or application can only be said to
be loaded when the content is also visualized; that is, when an image
can be seen.
* When the measured application is running on a distant system and the
Workflow has to use a Citrix client, VCN, or a similar remote connection
tool that only displays the user interface graphically but does not give
back handles, Image search is the only way to ascertain that the desired
content has appeared onscreen.
* Finally, the position of the image can be used to place a mouse click
relatively to the image, for example to enter a URL in the address bar
of a web browser, or to enter login information into user and password
fields.

What the _Image search_ actually does is compare the recorded _Pattern
image_ to the whole _Search area_. During execution, it takes a
screenshot of the _Search area_, applies the selected _Image search_
algorithm to it, and then compares it to the _Pattern image_. The
_Search area_ will automatically be adjusted if the executing computer
has a different screen resolution to the computer the _Workflow_ was
originally created on. Also, it will use the lowest common color depth
setting, so for example, if you created an _Image search_ with a color
depth of 32 bits, but the executing computer only has a color depth of
16 bits, the original _Pattern image_ will be converted on the fly to
match the current system's color depth. You can adjust this within the
link:#WorkflowProperties[_Workflow Properties_].

=== Properties

* *Compare Precision* This is an additional setting for the search
algorithm modes _Color_ and _Gradient_. In these modes the actual color
value of a pixel is recorded. The result is not the exact same value
every time a pixel value is calculated by the GPU. By lowering the
compare precision to 98% or 97%, you can allow the value to vary a
little in the least significant bits.
* *Edge detection threshold* Threshold for the difference (distance)
between colors that leads to the detection of an edge. A low threshold
leads to many detected edges because even a small difference in a
pixel's color value in comparison to its neighbors' is detected as an
edge. Conversely, a high threshold leads to fewer edges in the _Pattern
image_ the algorithm is searching for.
* *Hide Mouse* If this option is enabled, the mouse pointer is moved to
the upper left corner of the desktop during the _Image search_. Enable
this to avoid triggering hover effects in applications and on websites.
This is to ensure that the mouse pointer is not partly covering the
image searched for. Afterwards it is moved back to the previous
position.
* *Image search algorithm* _Image search_ algorithm to be used.
Selectable are _Color_, _Gradient_, _Contour_, and _Contour Plus_. Look
below for descriptions of these modes.
* *Image search type _Search for picture appear_* Search for the picture
until it appears. As soon as it can be detected, the _Image search_ is
considered successful.
* *Image search type _Search for picture disappear_* The _Image search_
is considered successful as soon as the image cannot be found. An image
does not have to be found first, so if finding the image is necessary an
_Image search_ with search type _Appear_ must be performed first.
* *Original desktop color depth* (_Properties grid_ only): Color depth
in bits at the time the image was recorded
* *Original desktop height* (_Properties grid_ only): Desktop height in
pixels at the time the image was recorded
* *Original desktop width* (_Properties grid_ only): Desktop width in
pixels at the time the image was recorded
* *_Pattern Image_ File Path* (_Properties grid_ only): File location of
the recorded image
* *_Pattern image_ rect* (_Properties grid_ only): Original coordinates
(upper left corner, lower right corner) of the rectangular area on the
desktop enclosing the image to be searched
* *Percentage required* Determines tolerance of the _Image search_, i.e.
the minimum quality percentage threshold needed for successful
identification of an image. A lower value means a higher tolerance, but
also increases the likelihood of a "false positive". We *strongly*
recommend never setting this below 90%!
* *Relative To* Makes the _Search Area_ relative to a previous _Image
search_, in the same way as for the _Mouse Clicks Action Step_
* *_Search area_ rect* (_Properties grid_ only): Original coordinates
(upper left corner, lower right corner) of the rectangular area on the
desktop enclosing the _Search area_
* *Wait time [ms]* The pause between two subsequent __Image search__es
(only used if _Wait until image is steady_ is activated)
* *Wait until image is steady* This function is used to perform a second
_Image search_ after the image is detected and introduces an additional
_Wait time._ The result of this second run compared to the previous one
is to ensure that the image is still there and has not changed its
position. If the results are equal, then the _Image search_ is
considered successful. If not, additional __Image search__es are
performed until two subsequent ones have the same result or until the
timeout is reached.
* *Interrupt time [ms]* Mainly used for _Java_ Applications: time in
milliseconds _ServiceTracer® Client_ stops searching for a picture to
provide CPU resources to an application with bad performance (only
applicable if _Load Optimizer_ is activated)
* *Load Optimizer* If enabled, there is a pause between every attempt to
find the image onscreen, as defined by the _Interrupt time_ setting.
This pause allows time for other programs to do something when running
on a single core computer.
* *Performance Limit (%)* Defines how much of the CPU performance can be
used for the _Image search_ (only applicable if _Load Optimizer_ is
activated)

=== Variables

* *Find Coordinate* The X/Y coordinate of where the picture was found

=== Wizard


* *Start from scratch* Starts the configuration using all steps.
* *_Search area_* Only reconfigures the _Search area_, using a previously captured image.
* *_Pattern image_* Only recaptures the image to search for
* *Refresh _Search area_* Refreshes the _Search area_ frame on the right-hand side of the wizard with the current desktop situation, so you can check if the defined _Search area_ still includes the image.
* *Check search* Evaluate the probability the captured image will be found. The result will be shown in a box above the _Pattern image_ frame and comprises the position of the image found, as well as the match precision in percent (this feature uses the current desktop and not the image shown in the _Search area_ frame).
* *Show borders* If active; the _Pattern image_ is marked with a blue border and the _Search area_ is marked with a red border in the _Search area_ frame.
* *_Pattern image_* Shows the recorded image that will be used in searches.
* *_Search area_* Shows the desktop situation when the image was captured onscreen.
If _Show Borders_ is active, borders of the search image are shown in blue and borders of the _Search area_ are shown in red.
If you performed a _Check search_ and the image could be found, its position will be marked by a green border.

To start configuring an _Image search_ _Action Step_ with the wizard,
click _Start from scratch_. A blue selection frame appears that can be
dragged and dropped onto the desktop section that contains the image you
want to search for. This selection frame always lies on top of the
desktop view, so you can switch to any desktop section containing the
image without losing sight of the selection frame. To narrow the
selection frame down to the relevant content, grab the edges, and resize
it. You can also fine-tune the frame by pressing the arrow keys on your
keyboard, which will move the frame by 1 pixel at a time; if you press
*_Ctrl_* + arrow key, the frame will move by 5 pixels at a time.
Pressing *_Shift_* + arrow key will resize the frame 1 pixel at a time
(See also the section Hotkeys).

Choosing and capturing the right pattern is essential for creating a
stable _Workflow_ – you need to select a pattern that does not change,
is unique, is initially visible at all screen resolutions the _Workflow_
is intended to run with, and (ideally) does not change its position
much.

=== Freezing the Desktop

If you want to capture a _Pattern image_ that is only visible for a
short amount of time or under specific conditions, you can freeze the
desktop in its current state to select the _Pattern image_. To freeze
the desktop, simply press _Pause_ on your keyboard. You can also click
on the bar _Hover or click here to freeze Desktop_ to start a timer.
Then you have five seconds to create the situation on the desktop that
you want to capture. Use the freeze function to capture things that only
show with direct mouse input, such as hover effects.

Once the desktop is frozen, a big _Unfreeze_ button will appear on the
selection frame. Click it to unfreeze the desktop again.

=== Using Zoom View for Small Selections

If you have to capture a very small part of the screen (which is always
a good thing if this part is unique enough to be used for
identification), you might need an enhanced view of the _Pattern image_
content. Just enable the checkbox _Show Zoom View for small selections_
in the blue frame and a zoom view window will appear onscreen. It will,
however, only appear for small selections and disappear if your
selection gets too big.

=== Capturing the Image

Make sure the image contains as many contours as needed to identify the
desired part of the screen with 100% certainty. Try to keep images as
small as possible, because smaller images can be found faster and do not
need as much CPU performance. Avoid leaving too much empty space around
the image. If you are satisfied with the selection either press `F10`,
click _Capture_ or double-click anywhere on the frame to save the
selected area as the _Pattern image_.

Your _Pattern image_ size should always follow the rule "as big as
necessary, as small as possible" to ensure good, steady search
performance.

=== Capturing the Search Area

After you captured the _Pattern image_, a red frame will appear to
define the search area.

/image::toolbox-checks-image-search-image2.png[Example capturing the Search Area]

This is the area of the screen that will later be searched for the
_Pattern image_. Again, this selection should be "as big as necessary,
as small as possible" – it needs to be large enough to always contain
the _Pattern image_, but as small as possible to reduce the CPU load
during the search. A larger _Search area_ always means higher CPU load
and higher response times. However, keep in mind that the _Pattern
image_ to be identified may be displayed in different desktop positions,
so do not narrow the _Search area_ down too much.

You can save the _Search area_ the same way you saved the _Pattern
image_.

After selecting the _Pattern image_ and the _Search area_, RPA Builder evaluates the accuracy with which the defined image is currently found.

//image::toolbox-checks-image-search-image3.png[Example accuracy]

A newly recorded image search should always be found with 100% accuracy.

=== The Different Search Modes

*_Color_* +
The simplest and fastest search algorithm. In the default configuration,
the color of the image searched must exactly match the color of the
recorded image. However, because the color values of images can differ
on the machines the _Workflow_ will run on (depending on the graphics
hardware used), you may downscale the _Compare Precision_ settings to
stabilize the image search. The color match precision can be downscaled
from 100% (exact match) to 88% (ignoring the least significant four bits
of the color value).

Nevertheless, we strongly recommend using the _Color_ search algorithm
only if the hardware the _Workflow_ runs on does not differ from the
hardware it was created on.

*_Gradient_* +
Uses edges to detect the _Pattern image_, but checks gray values before
the actual edge search is performed. Thus it can detect the presence of
an image faster than contour mode using a similar precision. Using gray
values has the side effect of being less tolerant regarding color
variations than contour mode. Also, colors leading to the same gray
value cannot be distinguished from one another.

*_Contour_* +
This is the recommended default search algorithm, because it is very
stable regarding color variations and can handle changes in color depth
and different desktop resolutions. It creates a contour search image
based on the transitions between the different color values in the
_Pattern image_ by reducing all colors to black areas while edges become
white lines.

*_Contour Plus_* +
This search algorithm was created specifically to identify characters
and writing. It basically uses the same technique as _Contour_ mode, but
with additional compensation for font smoothing.

=== Adjusting Threshold for Contour and Contour Plus Mode

When you are using one of the contour modes, you can adjust the
black/white threshold. The default value, 10, is usually the optimal
setting for images with high contrast; you should not need to adjust it,
particularly if you are searching for text. However, when searching for
low contrast _Pattern images_ and actual pictures, you might need to
adjust the slider until you see a clear contour.

//image::toolbox-checks-image-search-image4.png[Adjust the slider]

////
For example, we want to use the face of this woman as a _Pattern image_
in _Contour_ mode:

image::toolbox-checks-image-search-image5.png[Example pattern]

After recording the image, the default value of the threshold will
produce this _Pattern image_:

image::toolbox-checks-image-search-image6.png[Example pattern]

Here you can see that a lot of the subtle variations in the color of the
woman's face created edges in the contour picture.

By increasing the black/white threshold, the subtle color variations are
ignored, so we can see a clear contour and the picture can be detected
reliably:

image::toolbox-checks-image-search-image7.png[Example pattern]
////

=== Troubleshooting

If you have problems finding the same picture on different machines, you
should first make sure that the system parameters of these systems are
all the same (see Section Checking System Parameters).

If you are still having problems, you can decrease the required match
precision – but be careful; if the required percentage is too low, you
might get a "false positive", i.e. find the _Pattern image_ even though
it does not exist.

//image::toolbox-checks-image-search-image8.png[Image search settings]

We *strongly* recommend that you never use a match precision below 90%.
