The _Iterate over Files_ Action Step performs various Action Steps on a
specified number of files. Drag the Action Steps to be processed into
the gray area labeled _Drop Items here_ using drag and drop. The Action
Steps placed there will be processed from top to bottom in the order
specified. This means that the Action Steps for processing will be
applied to all files located in a folder and, depending on the settings,
its sub-folders. It is possible to set various parameters such as the
maximum number of files to be processed.

== Properties

*File Operation Settings:*

* *Directory path*
Enter the path to the directory where the files to be processed are
located. You can specify an absolute or relative path. If a relative
path is used, then the path relates to the _Base Path_ variable.
* *File name* Use placeholders here to specify the names of the files to
be processed. Use the placeholders * and ? and all allowed characters to
construct a search expression. The placeholder *.* is used by default.
This will find all files in a directory.

A list of invalid characters is provided in the section
*Path/file name/invalid characters*.

Examples of how to construct search expressions are provided at the end
of this section.

* *Force error if iteration limit is exceeded* Set whether the Workflow
is to be interrupted and an error message generated. This is applicable
in the following two cases:
** If the number of files for processing set under *Max iterations* has
been reached and *Use iteration limit* is enabled.
** If the maximum number of 100,000 files has been processed.
* *Max iterations* Set the maximum number of files that should be
processed until _Iterate over files_ ends. You can specify up to 100,000
iterations. Max iterations will only be taken into account if you enable
the option *Use iteration limit*.
* *Recursive loop* Specify whether the sub-folders located in the
specified *Directory path* and any files they may contain are to be
included in the processing.
* *Use iteration limit* Enable this option if you want to process a
limit of up to 100,000 files. Set the limit in the field *Max
iterations*.

Other Properties that are the same in all Action Steps are described in
the section on *Common Properties*. For reasons of
clarity they are not shown here.

== Inbound Variables

*Directory path*
Enter the path to the directory where the files to be processed are
located. You can specify an absolute or relative path. If a relative
path is used, then the path relates to the _Base Path_ variable.

* *File name* Use placeholders here to specify the names of the files to
be processed. Use the placeholders * and ? and all allowed characters to
construct a search expression. The placeholder *.* is used by default.
This will find all files in a directory.

== Outbound Variables

*Count Of Processed Elements* The _Iterate over Files.Count of Processed
Elements_ variable provides the number of files that have been
processed.

== Wizard

* *Directory path* Specify the path to the files here. You can create an
absolute path or a path relative to the _Base Path_.
//using the image:media\image1.png[image,width=175,height=22] and
//image:media\image2.png[image,width=129,height=22] buttons.
The initial
value is %STWS_BASEPATH%. Select an existing path.
//using the image:media\image3.png[image,width=20,height=20] button.
You can also
insert variables from the _Workflow_ in order to construct the path. To
do so, click on the pin and select one of the available variables.
////
More information about the environment variables (Insert Environment
Variable) and script variables (Insert Script Variable) can be found in
the section *Settings*.
////

* *File name* Use placeholders here to specify the names of the files to
be processed. Use the placeholders * and ? and all allowed characters to
construct a search expression. The placeholder *.* is used by default.
This will find all files in a directory. You can also insert a variable
from the Workflow as the _File Name_. To do so, click on the pin and
select one of the available variables.

A list of invalid characters is provided in section
*File Operations*.

Examples of how to construct search expressions are provided at the end
of this section.

* *Iteration limit* Enable this option to to set a limit on how many
files can be iteratively processed. Enter your desired limit in the
adjacent field; the maximum is 100,000.
* *Force error if iteration limit is exceeded* Set whether the Workflow
is to be interrupted and an error message generated. This is applicable
in the following two cases:
** If the *Iteration limit* is enabled and the number of files entered
in that field has been reached.
** If the maximum number of 100,000 files has been processed.
* *Recursive loop over all sub-folders* Set whether the sub-folders
located in the specified *Directory path* and any files they may contain
are to be included in the processing.

== Example

Use individual question marks (?) and allowed characters in the *File
name* field to find a specific number of variable letters or numeric
digits in the file name. The placeholder ???_log.* will, for example,
find all files with three unknown characters at the start of the file
name, followed by “_log”. If you do not know the number of unknown
characters, but a constant piece of text appears in the file name, then
you can use *_log*.* This search expression finds all files containing
_log in the file name. You can also omit the placeholder .* (this is
used to search for the file extension).

A list of invalid characters is provided in the section
*Path/file name/invalid characters*.
