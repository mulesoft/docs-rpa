The String Operations Action Step allows you to modify strings. It
provides a variety of operations for this purpose.

== Properties

*Input Text* Here, enter the string that you want to modify. This can be
entered using the keyboard or in the wizard, including with the help of
the pin variables.

== Inbound Variables

//link:\l[*Input text*]
*Input Text* Here, enter the string that you want to modify. This can be
entered using the keyboard or in the wizard, including with the help of
the pin variables.

If you have selected the _Find and replace text_ mode, the following
variables are also displayed.

*Find what* Here, enter what is to be found and replaced. You can enter
any text you wish or define the text via the pin variable.

*Replace with* Here, enter what is to replace the text found under _Find
what_. Again, you can enter any text you wish or define the text via the
pin variable.

== Outbound Variables

*Result* The modified string is output as the result. You can then use
it in the subsequent Action Steps.

== Wizard

_Undefined_ is the default value in the *String operation* field. You
first have to select an operation.

You can use one of the following modes:

With *Find and replace text*, you can search for specific parts of the
text and replace them.

//image:media\image2.png[Ein Bild, das Text enthält. Automatischgenerierte Beschreibung,width=290,height=71]

*Example:*

String = DE123456789

Find what = DE

Replace with = FR

Output = FR123456789

*Left (take first characters)* Enter the number of characters that are
to be output as the result.
//In the example below, the first 4 characters are displayed as the result.

//image:media\image3.png[Ein Bild, das Text enthält. Automatisch generierte Beschreibung,width=305,height=56]

*Example:*

String = DE123456789

Number of characters = 4

Output = DE12

*Right (take last characters)* Here, you specify how many characters
from the end of the string are to be output as the result.

*Trim left (remove first characters)* With this option, you can specify
the length that the string is to be shortened by. Selecting _Trim left_
means that the string is shortened from the
beginning.
//image:media\image4.png[image,width=307,height=57]

*Example:*

String = DE123456789

Number of characters = 4

Output = 3456789

*Trim right (remove last characters)* In the same way as with _Trim
left_, you determine the length of the string. The only difference is
that the string is shortened at the end.

The various modes cannot be combined with each other.
