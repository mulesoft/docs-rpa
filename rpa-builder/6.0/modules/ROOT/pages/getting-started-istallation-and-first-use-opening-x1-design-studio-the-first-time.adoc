== Opening X1 Design Studio the First Time

If you log in for the first time after installing X1 Design Studio, you
will be requested to connect to an X1 Server. To do this, enter the
Server Address, User Name, Customer and Password in the input window
that opens.

If the login is successful, a connection is established to the Server
Repository and you can begin working with X1 Design Studio.

It is only possible to open X1 Design Studio and log in to the X1 Server
if you imported the correct license on the server and assigned it to the
user (see also the X1 Server Online Manual for more information).
