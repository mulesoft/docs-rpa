= Mouse Actions

The _Mouse Actions_ Action Step emulates mouse moves and clicks.
Keyboard inputs can be used to modify the mouse clicks.

You can capture mouse actions directly or create and/or edit them in the
wizard. The speed of mouse actions can also be defined.

Mouse moves can be created relative to a specific coordinate. This
coordinate may be determined by a previous _Action Step_ such as a image
or text search, for example.

== Properties

*Miscellaneous*

*Relative To* (default: 0.0) Anchor point relative to which the mouse
action is to be performed. If no _Pin_ variable has been assigned, this
is the top-left corner of the screen.  This anchor point can also be set as a placeholder (<<Inbound Variables>>).

Please note that the _Action Step_ that returns the coordinates must
occur within the same _Transaction_ in order to appear here as a
possible _Pin_ variable.

//[#MouseClickTiming .anchor]##

*Mouse Click Timing*

*Mouse Click Down Delay* (ms, default: 200) Duration in milliseconds for
which a mouse button is held down.

*Mouse Click Up Delay* (ms, default: 10) Pause between two mouse clicks
in milliseconds.

*Mouse speed* (0–100, default: 4) The mouse must be moved to perform a
click. This setting is used to set the speed of this move. High values
produce a slower movement. The value 0 disables the movement, meaning
that the mouse jumps instantaneously.

== Inbound Variables

The property _Relative To_ can be linked to a _Pin_ variable of the type
_Coordinate_. The mouse action is then performed relative to this
coordinate rather than the top-left corner of the screen.

== Outbound Variables

The _Group_ block possesses no outbound variables.

_Capturing mouse actions_

It is easy to capture the desired mouse action using the wizard for the
_Mouse Actions_ Action Step.

First click on the image:media\image3.png[image,width=53,height=23]
button. The capture process now begins. Every mouse action that you
perform will be detected and saved.

If you have enabled the image:media\image4.png[image,width=30,height=23]
_Display mouse clicks on surface_ option, the mouse actions performed
will be shown in red on the screen and labeled with the ID, click count,
and type. In the example you can see a first, one-off click using the
left-hand mouse button.

generierte Beschreibung,width=174,height=100]

Use the F10 key to end the capture process.

_Editing specific mouse actions_

In the wizard, you can configure and post-process captured mouse
actions.

To post-process them, select the relevant line using the mouse and click
the image:media\image6.png[image,width=20,height=21] _Edit mouse action_
button. You can adjust the following settings from the _Mouse Action
Edit Window_:

image:media\image7.png[image,width=249,height=191]
////

*Click position* Pair of X and Y pixel coordinates where the mouse
action is to be performed.

**Mouse Action**The specific mouse action that is to be performed:

* *None* Mouse to hover over an element. No mouse button is pressed; the
mouse stays still.

To capture a hover action, you must initially perform a mouse click at
the relevant position. You can then change this in the _Mouse Action
Edit Window_ from _Left_ to _None_ under _Mouse Action_ (one of the
properties).

* *Left* The left mouse button gets pressed.
* *Middle* The middle mouse button gets pressed.
* *Right* The right mouse button gets pressed.
* *LeftUp* (in the case of drag and drop) The left mouse button is
released following a drag operation (moving the mouse with the button
held down).
* *LeftDown* (in the case of drag and drop) The left mouse button is
held down during a drag operation (moving the mouse with the button held
down).
* *RightUp* The right mouse button is released following a drag
operation (moving the mouse with the button held down).
* *RightDown* The right mouse button is held down during a drag
operation (moving the mouse with the button held down).
* *WheelUp* The mouse wheel scrolls forwards/up.
* *WheelDown* The mouse wheel scrolls backwards/down.

*Click Count* (0-99) The number of clicks within the mouse action.

When capturing a double-click, please make sure that the mouse doesn’t slip during the process.

Check how the operation has been captured in the wizard. If _LeftDown_ and _LeftUp_ have been saved there because the coordinates differ, please correct this as follows:

. Remove one line from the incorrectly captured double-click.
. Set the _Mouse Action_ property to _Left_ and _Counts_ to _2_.

*Modifier* Mouse actions can be modified by combinations of keys. This makes it possible, for example, to mark related or individual elements using the mouse.
////
The following modifiers are available:

image:media\image9.png[Ein Bild, das Text enthält. Automatischgenerierte Beschreibung,width=235,height=190]
////

*Initial Action Delay [ms]* (default: 500 ms) You can enter a delay of
between 0 and 999999999 ms between the cursor movement and the start of
the actual mouse action. This would be necessary, for example, if a
clickable element only becomes visible when the mouse pointer is hovered
over it. Select the checkbox next to _Enable initial action delay_ to
enable this.

*Enable initial action delay* enables the _Initial Action Delay_
property to be used.

_Other wizard functionality_
////
image:media\image10.png[image,width=51,height=21] ends the process of
capturing mouse actions. This button can only be used if the option
_Hide this window when capturing_ has been disabled. Otherwise use the
F10 key to end the capturing process.
////
//image:media\image11.png[image,width=49,height=22]
*Move mouse action up/down* moves the selected mouse action up or down in the table. The ID
of the action remains unchanged. Mouse actions are performed in the
order in which they appear in the table, regardless of their ID.

//image:media\image12.png[image,width=20,height=21]
*Add mouse action* It is possible to add a mouse action that you configure solely using the wizard rather than actually capturing it.
//Clicking this button opens the_Mouse Action Edit Window_ described above.
//Click _OK_ to confirm what you have entered and the mouse action will be added at the end of the table. You can then use _Move mouse action up_ or _down_ to put it in the right position.

//image:media\image13.png[image,width=25,height=23]This button deletes the selected mouse action. The other IDs are not changed in the process.

//image:media\image14.png[image,width=36,height=20] This button deletes all mouse actions.

*Hide this window when capturing* (default: enabled) If this option is enabled, the _Mouse Action Wizard_ window is hidden while mouse actions are captured.

*Hide main window when capturing* (default: enabled) If this option is
enabled, the _X1 Design Studio_ window is hidden while mouse actions are
captured.

*Relative To* (default: none) The position where the mouse action is to
be performed can be defined based on a previously executed Action Step
(see also <<Inbound Variables>>).

*Mouse click timing* (see <<Properties>>).

== Creating Mouse Actions Relative to an Anchor Point

If the coordinate relative to which the mouse action is to be performed
is not yet known at the time of designing the mouse action, a notification will appear.
//image:media\image15.png[Ein Bild, das Text enthält. Automatischgenerierte Beschreibung,width=458,height=217]
Click OK to confirm.

Then click the mouse to set an anchor point at the position where you expect the coordinate to be and which the mouse action relates to.

//An anchor symbol will appear in this position:

//image:media\image16.png[image,width=29,height=28]

Then capture the other mouse actions that relate to this.

//image:media\image17.png[image,width=264,height=169]

At runtime, the anchor point will be replaced with the actual coordinate that is calculated at the time.
