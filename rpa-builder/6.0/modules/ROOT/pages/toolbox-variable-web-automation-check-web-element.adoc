== Check Element

Use this _Web Automation_ object to verify if a website or web
application element was loaded properly and how long this took. The
_Check Element_ object can be used on any website element.

=== Properties

[#AS_CheckElement_P_AttributeToCheck .anchor]####**Attribute to check**
Select an attribute to be checked in addition to the XPath element. The
drop-down menu automatically contains the available attributes for this
element.

*Expected Value* Define the value that the attribute must have to be
valid

[#AS_CheckElement_P_UseRegularExpression .anchor]####**Use regular
expression** Use this function if you want to use a regular expression
when checking the value of a selected attribute. For an introduction to
regular expressions, see Section link:#UsingRegularExpression[Using
Regular Expressions].

*Invert Check logic* If enabled, the _Check Element_ object waits until
the defined web element cannot be found any more, instead of waiting for
it to appear.

=== Outbound Variables

The Action Step _Check Element_ possesses no outbound variables.

=== Wizard

When you select the element you want to check using the _Browser
Wizard_, the available attributes for the element are listed in a
drop-down menu. After you have chosen an attribute, an expected value
must be defined for that attribute. The current value will automatically
be set as the default.

You can also use regular expressions to match the expected value. For
more information about regular expressions see Section
link:#UsingRegularExpression[Using Regular Expression].

This check works as follows:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
| |*Normal check logic* |*Invert check logic*
|*_Attribute to check_ is empty* |Only checks if there is an element at
the given XPath for the given timeout period. Fails if no element can be
found at the XPath for the whole timeout. |Checks if there is *no*
element at the given XPath or waits until it disappears. Fails if an
element is detected during the timeout period.

|*_Attribute to check_ has an entry* |In addition to the check above, if
the element is found, checks if the attribute to check is equal to the
_Expected Value_. Fails if the attribute does not equal the expected
value during the whole timeout period. |In addition to the check above,
if the element is found, checks if the attribute to check is *not* equal
to the _Expected Value_. Fails if the attribute equals the expected
value at any point during the whole timeout. Note that this check will
be instantly successful if the element cannot be found at all!
