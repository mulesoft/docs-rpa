You also need to make sure that the window colors and metrics of the
system a _Workflow_ is created on are identical to the systems the
_Workflow_ is supposed to run on. The window colors and metrics
determine how windows are displayed, including size, font and color of
captions, buttons, and various control elements.

To check these settings on Windows XP right-click on the Desktop and
select "Properties". Next, open the "Window Color and Appearance" tab.

To check and/or change
settings, select distinct elements by clicking on them in the upper part
of the dialog box or using the "Item" drop-down list. Make sure the
fonts, sizes, and colors are identical on every machine where the
_Workflow_ will be run and also on the system used to record the
_Workflow_.
