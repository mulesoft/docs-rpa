= Making Sure Windows Fonts Match

Ensure that the window colors and fonts of the
system a _Workflow_ is created on are identical to the systems the
_Workflow_ is going to run on. The window colors and fonts
determine how windows are displayed, including size, font and color of
captions, buttons, and various control elements.

== Verifying Windows Color Schemes and Font Sizes

To access the color and font settings for Windows:

. Open the Windows *Personalization* settings.
** Right-click on the Desktop and select *Personalize*, or
** Open the *Start* menu and go to *Settings* > *Personalization*.
. Click the *Colors* tab and verify the settings.

_Workflow_ will run and also on the system used to record the _Workflow_.

settings, select distinct elements by clicking on them in the upper part
of the dialog box or using the "Item" drop-down list. Make sure the
fonts, sizes, and colors are identical on every machine where the
_Workflow_ will be run and also on the system used to record the
_Workflow_.
