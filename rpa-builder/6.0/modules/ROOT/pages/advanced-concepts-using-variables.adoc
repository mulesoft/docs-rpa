=== Using Variables

Variables are powerful tools that allow you to save and use values
throughout your Workflow. You can predefine variables (the _Login Data_
in your _Workflow_ for example) or create variables at runtime (by using
_Read Clipboard_ for example) and then use these variables within other
_Action Steps_. Think of a variable as a placeholder for any
text/numeric constant, or value. When creating the _Workflow_, you can
create variables and use them as placeholders. During execution, these
variables will be resolved to the value you gave them or that you want
to assign to during execution. For example, if _Read Clipboard_ is used,
then the clipboard content at that point during execution will be
transferred to a variable and any _Action Step_ referencing that
variable will then use the value transferred.
