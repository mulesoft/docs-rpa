== Variable

This _Action Step_ makes it possible to set up a simple string variable.
This variable can also be made available globally for the entire
_Workflow_ under Properties and "Make Variable available in all
Transactions". Other variables can be used as Inbound Variables and
therefore made global.

=== Properties

*Variable Value* Defines the variable value which can be mapped onto another variable.

*Make Variable available in all Transactions* Makes the variable
available for the entire _Workflow_ in all transactions. Variables are
normally only available within their transaction.

=== Inbound Variables

*Suffix* can be used if the _Variable_ is located within the _Control
Blockâ€™s_ __File Controlled Loop__**.** A suffix is then added to the
name of the _Variable_ +++during every loop+++__.__ Each suffix is a
column entry in the file that was imported in the _File Controlled
Loop_.

*Variable Value* Defines the variable value which can be mapped onto another variable.

=== Outbound Variables

*Value* Returns the current value of the _Variable._
