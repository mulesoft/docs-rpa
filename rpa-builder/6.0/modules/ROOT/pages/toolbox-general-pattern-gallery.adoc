== Pattern Gallery

All search patterns belonging to a _Workflow_ are stored centrally in
the _Pattern Gallery._ Search patterns are image files which are used in
the _Search Pattern_ and _Pattern Select Action Steps_ to determine a
state.

Search patterns can be created directly in the _Pattern Gallery Wizard_.
They are also automatically transferred from the _Search Pattern_ and
_Pattern Select Action Steps_.

Search patterns that are not used can be deleted from the _Workflow._

There is no limit to the number of search patterns in a _Workflow_.

=== Properties

The _Pattern Gallery Action Step_ does not contain any additional
properties, other than the *Common Properties*.

=== Inbound Variables

The _Pattern Gallery Action Step_ does not produce any inbound
variables.

=== Outbound Variables

The _Pattern Gallery Action Step_ does not produce any outbound
variables.

=== Wizard

The _Pattern Gallery Wizard_ enables search patterns to be created,
processed, and searched for, which can be used throughout the entire
_Workflow._

=== Search Pattern Management

The basic functionality of the _Pattern Strip_ shown here, which
contains all the search patterns and menu bars, is described in the
*Pattern Strip* section. The _Pattern Gallery_ also
provides two extra buttons, in addition to the standard functions:

*Delete unused* deletes all _Search Patterns_ that are not used again in
the _Workflow_.

*Show usage* opens a new _Pattern usage_ window that lists all the
Action Steps that use the selected pattern, arranged by pattern.

All of the information displayed in this window about how the patterns
are used can be copied to the clipboard by clicking the *Copy to clipboard* button. The names of the __Action Step__s that make use of
the individual __Search Pattern__s can be copied to the clipboard by
clicking the button in the _Usage in Action Steps_ area of the window.
