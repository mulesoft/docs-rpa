== Force Error State

This _Action Step_ simply forces the _Workflow_ into an error state.
This also means that if you do not handle this error within a _Managed Block_, the _Workflow_ will always abort at this point and return with
an error. It does not have any additional properties and thus the wizard
will also be empty except for the _Name_ field.
