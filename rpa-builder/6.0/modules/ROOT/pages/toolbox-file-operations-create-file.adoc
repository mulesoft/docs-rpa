_Create File_ is used to create an empty file at the specified path.

== Properties

*File Operation Settings*

* *Create directory if it does not exist* If this option is enabled,
_Create File_ creates either the specified relative directory or the
whole specified path, if this does not already exist.
* *Directory path* This is where you enter the path to the directory where the file is to be
created. You can specify an absolute or relative path. If a relative
path is used, then the path relates to the _Base Path_ variable.
* *File Name** Enter the name of the file that is to be created here.
* *Force error if file exists* If this option has been enabled, an error
message will interrupt the _Workflow_ if a file with the same name
already exists. If this option has not been enabled and the file already
exists, it will be replaced with an empty file and and no acknowledgment
will be given.
* *Open with associated application* If this option has been enabled,
the newly created file will be opened with the application that is
associated with the file name of the new file. For example, if the new
file name ends in *.txt it will normally be opened with Notepad.

Leave this option disabled if you want another _Action Step_ to be able
to access the newly created file – otherwise it will be locked.

Other Properties that are the same in all Action Steps are described in
the section on *Common Properties*. For reasons of
clarity they are not shown here.

== Inbound Variables

* *Directory path* This is where you enter the path to the directory where the file is to be
created. You can specify an absolute or relative path. If a relative
path is used, then the path relates to the _Base Path_ variable.

* *File Name** Enter the name of the file that is to be created here.

== Outbound Variables

*IsCreated* The _Create File.IsCreated_ variable indicates whether the
file could be created or not (True/False).

*File name* The _Create File.File Name_ variable provides the name of
the file that has been created.

*Directory path* The _Create File.Directory Path_ variable provides the
path that is used.

== Wizard

* *Directory path* Specify the path here to the file that is being newly
created. You can create an absolute path or a path relative to the _Base
Path_.
//using the image:media\image1.png[image,width=175,height=22] and image:media\image2.png[image,width=129,height=22] buttons.
The initial value is %STWS_BASEPATH%. If you specify an absolute path and also
enable the option *Create Directory if it does not exist*, the directory
path will be created in full if it does not already exist. Select an
existing path.
//using the image:media\image3.png[image,width=20,height=20] button.
You can also insert variables from the _Workflow_ in order to
construct the path. To do so, click on the pin and select one of the
available variables.

More information about the environment variables (Insert Environment
Variable) and script variables (Insert Script Variable) can be found in
the section *Settings*.
////

* *File name* Enter the name of the file here that is to be created. If
you want the file to open with the associated program (option: Open
created file with associated application), you must also specify a file
extension. You can also insert a variable from the Workflow as the _File
Name_. To do so, click on the pin and select one of the available
variables.
* *Force error if file exists* If this option has been enabled, an error
message will interrupt the _Workflow_ if a file with the same name
already exists. If this option has not been enabled and the file already
exists, it will be replaced with an empty file and and no acknowledgment
will be given.
* *Open with associated application* If this option has been enabled,
the newly created file will be opened with the application that is
associated with the file name of the new file. For example, if the new
file name ends in *.txt it will normally be opened with Notepad.
* *Create directory if it does not exist* If this option is enabled,
_Create File_ creates either the specified relative directory or the
whole specified path, if this does not already exist.

== Example

Create an empty file using the _Create File_ Action Step and write text
to that file using the _Write to Text File_ Action Step. The _Write to
Text File_ Action Step can be pointed directly to the newly created file
using, for example, the _Create File.Directory Path_ and _Create
File.FileName_ variables. This allows you to create your own log file
containing text that is of interest to you.
