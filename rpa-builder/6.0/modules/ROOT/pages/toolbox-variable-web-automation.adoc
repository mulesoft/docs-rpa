== Web Automation

_Web Automation_ is a plug-in created specifically to automate browsers
and web-based applications. In contrast to the regular _Action Steps_,
this new technique does not just simulate user operations, but is also
able to handle and control objects within a web-based application. This
can be used for any website or application that runs in a browser.
