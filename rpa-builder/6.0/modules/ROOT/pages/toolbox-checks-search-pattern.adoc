
= Search Pattern

The _Search Pattern_ _Action Step_ searches for one or more patterns
within a defined _Search Area_ on the screen.

Patterns can be taken directly from a screenshot or from the
_Workflow_'s _Pattern Gallery_. All patterns for a _Workflow_ are saved
in the _Pattern Gallery_.

The search algorithm is fast and stable. Search results can be reused in
subsequent _Action Steps_, for example as a reference point for mouse
clicks.

Various aspects of the search are configurable. You may choose to search
for one of more patterns, decide whether an image may appear in the
search area or not, and exclude patterns containing the pattern being
searched for within them from the search. A tolerance for deviations
between the pattern found and the pattern being searched for may also be
set. It is possible to monitor that the position or existence of the
image does not change within a defined period.

The search can be tested prior to executing the _Workflow_. An
evaluation window shows possible matches and provides information about
how search results could be improved.

== Properties

* *Image Processing*

** *Allow multiple matches of a found pattern*
+
If this option is selected, the pattern may appear more than once in the _Search Area_.
When this option is not selected, the _Search Pattern Action Step_
returns an error if the pattern is found but occurs more than once. In
the wizard this option is listed under _Search Settings_ as _Allow
multiple matches of a found pattern_.
+
If the coordinates of the pattern found are to be reused subsequently in
a different _Action Step_ (e.g. for mouse clicks relative to pattern),
the coordinates used in the case of multiple identical patterns found
will be the ones for the pattern furthest to the left within the
_Search_ _Area_. If multiple identical search images are located on top
of each other in the same position on the left, the topmost image will
be selected.

** *Hide mouse*
+
Moves the cursor during the search to the upper left
corner of the screen to the position with the coordinates x=0 and y=0.
By this way unwanted mouse hover effects can be avoided. Independently
of this setting the cursor is not included in the search. So also search
patterns covered by the cursor symbol are found. After the search the
cursor is set back to its original position.
** *Margin for automatic search area [pixel]*
+
Number of pixels around a
found pattern for defining the search area automatically. Valid values
are between 0 and 999; the default-value is 100.
** *Neighborhood Pixel*
+
Indicates the number of pixels by which the
position of a pixel found may differ from the specified position. The
default value for this setting is 1.
+
It is easier to search for similar images if the value
is greater than 1, which means the images are not 100% identical based on
pixels. The percentage score may vary by some percentage values
depending on position though.

** *Original Desktop Size*
+
Screen resolution at the time the image search
was last tested. This size is required in order to scale the _Search
Area_ (but not the _Search Pattern_) if the _Workflow_ is used on a
device with a different screen resolution.
** *Pattern Steady check*
+
Enables the option *Wait For Pattern Steady Timeout* and checks whether the coordinates of the pattern found change
again within this time period. If not, the search is successful and
ends; otherwise the search is repeated.
** *Reduce Score By [%]*
+
When testing the _Search Pattern_ settings,
matches by this percentage below the _Score_ are also shown. These are
marked yellow in the test result window.
+
In the wizard, this setting shows under _Search Settings_ and appears
as a yellow zone on the _Required matching precision (%)_ slider.

** *Score [%]*
+
Indicates the accuracy in percent by which the pattern
found must match the specified pattern in order to be considered found.
In the wizard, this setting is labeled _Required matching precision (%)_
under _Search Settings_ and appears as a green zone on a slider.
** *Search Mode*
*** *Match all patterns*
+
The search is successful if all of the specified patterns are found.
*** *Match only one pattern*
The search is successful if exactly one of the
specified patterns is found.
*** *Match one or more patterns*
+
The search is successful if at least one of the
specified patterns is found.
** *Wait for Pattern Steady Timeout [ms]*
+
If the option *Pattern steady check* is selected, a check for whether the pattern found is still in
the same position, or whether it still does not appear in the _Search Area_, is performed according to the interval value entered here (or in the wizard under *Search Settings* > *Check whether found match stays in same location every [time in ms] milliseconds*). If this is the case,
the search is successful and ends. Otherwise, the search is repeated
either until it is successful or the _Action Step_ times out. A value of
0 means that the position of the pattern found is not rechecked after
having been found. The _Action Step_ does not then wait beyond its
runtime.

== Inbound Variables

* *Find Coordinate*
+
If there is at least one other Action Step that uses patterns before the
Action Step Search Pattern, the outbound variable _Find coordinate_
becomes the inbound variable for the subsequent Action Steps.

== Outbound Variables

* *Find Coordinate*
+
Topnleft corner of the pattern that has been found successfully. If a search
is made for multiple patterns and they are found, the coordinates
returned are of the image on the far left of the series of patterns
being searched for as specified in the wizard. If multiple identical
patterns are found in the same position on the far left of the _Search Area_, the topmost one is used for the coordinates.

* *Found Pattern Name*
+
The name of the matched pattern as entered in the
_Pattern Gallery_.

* *Found Matched Pattern Count*
+
Number of found search patterns from the
_Regular_ category. The number of matches can consist of matches for
different patterns. Matches of patterns of the category _Ignore_ and
_Exclude_ are not counted.
+
*Found Matched Pattern Count* is 0 if _Search Pattern_ returns an
error, even if matches for patterns of the _Regular_ category are
found.

== Wizard


The _Search Pattern Wizard_ enables you to select _Search Patterns_ and the
key search settings.

The basic functionality of the _Pattern Strip_, including all
pattern operations, is described in the section Pattern Strip.

Click _OK_ to confirm the configuration settings or _Cancel_ as
applicable. The _Test_ button evaluates the search and displays the
results in the _Search Results_ window.

== Regular Patterns

This section lists patterns that are to be found. The number of patterns
that can be found is limited to 25.

There are three ways of searching for patterns:

* *Match only one pattern*
+
The search is successful if _exactly one_ of the selected
patterns is found in the _Search Area_. An error is returned if none or
a number of the selected patterns are found.

* *Match one or more patterns*
+
The search is successful if _at least one_ of the
selected patterns is found in the _Search Area_. An error is returned if
none of the selected patterns are found.

* *Match all patterns*
+
The search is successful if _all_ of the selected patterns are
found in the _Search Area_. An error is returned if none or not all of
the selected patterns are found.
+
If a pattern appears multiple times, a successful search will occur as
above if _Allow multiple matches of a found pattern_ is enabled in the
_Search Settings_. The _Action Step_ will otherwise return an error if
the same pattern appears multiple times.
+
Patterns may be chosen from the _Pattern Gallery_ or created by means of
a screenshot (_Capture_).

//TODO: recapture this
//image::toolbox-checks-search-pattern-image1.png[Example patterns]

Click to select one or multiple patterns and delete or move them as a
group. When a pattern is selected, a white tick will appear on a green
background in the top right corner. To undo the selection, click the
_Clear Selection_ button. A vertical black line indicates where the
pattern can be moved to using drag and drop. If _Match one or more
patterns_ is selected, the first pattern in the list will have a blue
border. This image can be used as a reference point for other Action
Steps as the Workflow progresses (see Other Uses of Matched Patterns).


== Capture Pattern

One way of defining a pattern is to take a screenshot that shows it.

The functionality of the _Capture Pattern_ button is described in the
section Capturing the Search Pattern.

All patterns captured using the _Search Pattern_ _Action Step_ are
transferred to the _Workflow_'s _Pattern Gallery_.

== Add Pattern from Gallery

If the _Pattern Gallery_ for the _Workflow_ already contains patterns,
they can be added to the list of patterns for the _Action Step_ using
the _Add Pattern from Gallery_ button.

The _Select Patterns to add_ window shows all the images that the
_Workflow_'s _Pattern Gallery_ contains. A white tick on a green
background in the top right corner indicates patterns which are already
included in the _Search Pattern_ _Action Step_. Patterns already
included in another category of the same _Action Step_ are not shown.

//image::toolbox-checks-search-pattern-image2.png[Select patterns to add]

To add patterns to the search, simply use the mouse to click and select.
Use the same method to deselect patterns which should no longer be
included in the search.

Click OK to confirm the selection and add it to the pattern list for the
_Action Step_.

== Ignore All Matches within These Patterns

//image::toolbox-checks-search-pattern-image3.png[Example pattern]

If checking for the single occurrence of a pattern that may be part of
other patterns, you must exclude patterns containing the searched-for
pattern within them from the search. The number of patterns that can be
excluded is limited to 25.

As described above, patterns to be excluded from the search can be
inserted here using screenshot or from the Pattern Gallery.

Example: Search for the word staff as a noun but only if it doesn't form
part of another term, e.g. 'staffing'. This pattern must be included in
the green field among the patterns being searched for. Other patterns
containing this term, e.g. staffing or staffed must be added here.

Areas in a single color are not taken into account within the pattern.
It is therefore not sufficient in the above example to capture staff
with free space at the right edge, because this free space will not form
part of the pattern being searched for due to a lack of _features_.

== Make Sure None of These Patterns Appear

//image::toolbox-checks-search-pattern-image4.png[Example for exluded patterns]

The _Search Pattern_ _Action Step_ can also be used to check that a
certain pattern does not appear.

If rechecking that a pattern does not appear, the option *Check whether
found match stays in same location every [time in ms] milliseconds* must
be enabled in the _Search Settings_ and the interval value (_Wait for
Image Steady Timeout [ms]_) cannot be 0.

As described above, patterns to be excluded from the search can be
inserted here using a screenshot or from the Pattern Gallery. The number
of patterns that can be excluded is limited to 25.

== Changing the Category for a Search Pattern

The patterns selected can be moved between the categories _Regular_ and
_Ignored_. Use the _Move to..._ button in the menu bar to do this.


== Search Settings

//image::toolbox-checks-search-pattern-image5.png[Search Settings wizard]

The settings needed most frequently for all types of search can be set
and modified using the _Search Pattern_ _Action Step_ wizard under
_Search Settings_.

The _Required matching precision_ in percent is shown as a green zone on
a slider. A yellow zone to the left of the green indicates the range
that was entered in the _Properties_ under _Reduce Score by [%]_ to
monitor criteria during the test in an advanced search.

You can use either the general _Timeout_ or your own.

If the option _Check whether found match stays in same location every
[time in ms] milliseconds (Wait for Image Steady Timeout [ms]_ in the
property pane) is enabled, it may make sense to choose a different
_Timeout_ depending on this value.

Because the repeated image search has to be completed in an interval
defined here within the timeout, the recommended maximum interval value
is ½*_timeout_.

If also checking that a pattern does not appear again (_Make sure none
of these patterns appears_), this option must be enabled and the
interval value must not be 0.

If the option _Allow multiple matches of a found of a pattern_ is
enabled, the pattern is allowed to occur in the _Search Area_ more than
once. When this option is not selected, the _Search Pattern Action Step_
returns an error if the pattern is found but occurs more than once.

_Move mouse to 0,0 while pattern search is active_ moves the cursor
during the search to the upper left corner of the screen to the position
with the coordinates x=0 and y=0. By this way unwanted mouse hover
effects can be avoided. Independently of this setting the cursor is not
included in the search. So also search patterns covered by the cursor
symbol are found. After the search the cursor is set back to its
original position.

The search area is displayed on the right side of the settings section.
Click the button _Define manually_ to define the search area by
drag&drop. The button _Define automatically_ automatically defines a
search area containing all _regular_ matches visible at the time of the
definition of the search area. The _ResetTo Full Screen_ button turns
the search area back to full screen.

The Search Area can be set to either a _fixed_ or dynamic (_relative_)
position. To define a dynamic position, use the _Relative To_ picklist,
which lists all variables of type _Coordinates_ that are available at
this point; these include, for example, Outbound Variables from a
previous _Search Pattern_ Action Step in the same transaction. When a
coordinate is selected in the wizard as “Relative To”, an offset vector
is immediately calculated. While the _Workflow_ is being designed, this
points from the selected coordinate to the top-left corner of the
_Search Area_. At _Workflow_ runtime, the calculated offset vector is
applied to the real-time value of the _Search Area_ that the coordinate
relates to. This means that the _Search Area_ at _Workflow_ runtime is
positioned at exactly the same distance from the “Relative To”
coordinate as at the time of design.

== Test

Pressing the _Test_ button will launch the search independently of
_Workflow_ execution and open the _Search Results_ window where the
search is evaluated. This can provide hints about possible improvements
that could be made to the _Search Settings_.

//image::toolbox-checks-search-pattern-image6.png[Search Result screen]

The screen content at the time the test was performed takes up the main
part of the window _Search Result_.

A blue border surrounds the _Search Area_. The area outside the _Search
Area_ is shown grayed.

_Matches_ are highlighted in color. The color legend at the right side
of the window works simultaneously as a check box panel for switching
the display of the different match types on and off. If there are no
matches of a certain type, the according check box field is shown
grayed.

_Search Patterns_ of the list _Match all / only one / one or more
pattern(s)_ found within the defined precision are highlighted green.
Matches from the list _Ignore all matches within these patterns_ are
highlighted light blue and matches from the list _Make sure none of
these patterns appear_ are highlighted red.

A yellow highlighting shows that the search pattern could have been
found if the precision had been set lower. This reduced precision is
calculated by deducting the _Reduced Score_ from the _Score._ In each
case, the precision of the match is stated.

Matches outside of the _Search Area_ are marked in gray color
irrespective of their type. . Patterns with a _Color Spot_ that are
found but do not match the _Color Spot_ color at a specific position are
marked in blue. You can see the type of every match in the details pane
on the right side of the window.

On opening the window, the size of the screenshot is adjusted so that
the whole screenshot is visible. You can zoom in to or out of the image
by dragging the slider at the right side of the screenshot. It is also
possible to do this by mouse wheel. Double click on the slider shows the
image in its original size. If the image is enlarged, scroll bars for
adjusting the position of the view appear on the right side and on the
lower border of the image.

Below the slider the current mouse position in relation to the screen
shown in the screenshot is displayed dynamically.

Mouse hover over a match shows the name, a thumbnail and the matching
precision as a tooltip.

Clicking on a found Pattern on the screenshot shows details to this
Pattern on the right side of the window.

Clicking a pattern in the tab _Pattern_ at the lower border of the
window shows details to all matches to this pattern. Clicking a match in
the screenshot only shows details for this single match. Details contain
the name, type, size in pixels and a thumbnail of the pattern along with
a color-marked listing of the found matches. For all matches, the
coordinates of the upper left corner and the matching precision are
displayed. The coloring is the same as described above.

//image::toolbox-checks-search-pattern-image7.png[Search Result screen]

Clicking a match in the details pane toggles the highlighting of the
according matches in the screenshot. Highlighting of a Match is
indicated in the details pane by a colored border and the intensifying
of its background color.

Clicking a _Match_ in the details pane displays an animated arrow
pointing to this match in the screenshot. In the process, the screenshot
is resized so it can be seen in its entirety within the window.

//image::toolbox-checks-search-pattern-image8.png[Example animated arrow]

The tab _Search Results Summary_ shows a textual overview over the
search settings and the search result.

If the search failed because of one single pattern, this pattern is
shown in tab _Failure Reason_.

== Other Uses of Matched Patterns

If mouse clicks are to be performed relative to a matched image and, at
the same time, the search is for more than one image, the image that the
mouse clicks relate to must be at the top of the list.

If the first image on the list is not found, the mouse click will be
inserted relative to the first image from the list that is found.

If the first image on the list that is found occurs multiple times, the
image located on the far left of the screen will be used. If there are
multiple images in the identical lateral position on the left, the
topmost one will be used. If multiple identical images are found, the
image on the far left or top far left will be used.
