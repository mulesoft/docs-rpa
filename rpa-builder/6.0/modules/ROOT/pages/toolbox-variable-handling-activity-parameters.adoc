== Variable Handling

=== Activity Parameters

The Action Step _Activity Parameters_ (AP) allows you to map variables
that you can use not only in the Workflow, but also in the activities of
the business process and gateways. This allows the APs to be exchanged
among the different elements. For example, the BPMN gateway uses the APs
to decide which activity should be executed next.

The Action Step _Activity Parameters_ can only be included once in a
process and will be placed automatically in the _Workflow
Initialization_.

*Defining Activity Parameters*

You define the parameters in the Business Process Initialization that
you find at the top right of the area of the Business Process Modeler.

First press image:media\image3.png[image,width=144,height=18] to select
the type of variable.

You can enter a name, description, and a value for the parameters
directly in the corresponding fields.

The AP name may consist of a combination of letters, numbers, and
underscores.

Special characters and spaces must not be used.

The initial letter of the name must be in lower case.

The AP name must be unique. It must not be used multiple times for
different variables.

The predefined values are test values that are only used for a local run
within RPA Builder. The variables are registered automatically
on RPA Manager when uploaded. There, you can modify the values of the
variables and define them differently, depending on the station on which
the Workflow is being executed (see also the chapter
link:#UsingVariables[Using Variables] and the Servicetrace® X1 Server
Online Manual).

Please note that the test value may change in the course of the BP due
to the possible assignment of new values. If the BP is started again,
the value will be reset to its initial value.

*Deleting Activity Parameters*

You can delete APs by returning to the Business Process Initialization
area. Press the image:media\image5.png[image,width=29,height=30] button
to delete the desired AP.

You can only delete an AP if it is not being used in a Workflow. If the
AP is already connected to at least one Workflow, the following message
appears:

image:media\image6.png[image,width=466,height=155]

All the Workflows in which the AP is used are displayed. To delete the
AP, you must remove the connections in all Workflows.

*Changing the Name of an Activity Parameter*

While you create a new AP, you can change the name at any time. As soon
as the wizard is closed with _OK_, the field remains grayed out and you
can no longer change the name. You can still edit the fields
_Description_ and _Value_ at any time.

If you want to subsequently change the name, you can delete the AP and
create it again with a new name. This only applies if the AP is not
already being used in a process.

*Connecting Activity Parameters to a Workflow*

To do this, you need the Action Step _Activity Parameters,_ which you
insert into the _Workflow Initialization_. All activity parameters are
listed in the wizard and can be connected to the Workflows in which they
should be used. The Action Steps can then be filled with the content of
the available APs with the aid of the pin variables

*Connecting Activity Parameters to a Gateway*

If you click on the BPMN gateway, a small toolbox opens containing a
puzzle icon. A wizard opens. You can enter the APs here. (see also
chapter link:#GatewayConditionExpression[Gateway condition expression])

==== Properties

*Misc*

* *Write Variables to Log File / Run Protocol* If this option is
enabled, the variable names and their values are written to the log file
and the run protocol.

For security reasons, passwords are not shown in the user account data.
Simply leave this option disabled if the variables or their values
contain confidential data.

==== Inbound Variables

The Action Step _Activity Parameters_ does not have any inbound
variables.

==== Outbound Variables

The Action Step _Activity Parameters_ does not have any outbound
variables.

==== Wizard

Click to select the desired parameters on the left in the _Available
Parameters_ column. You can use the arrows to drag them into the right
column and thereby insert them into the Workflow.

==== Handling for Activity Parameters When Importing a Workflow

If you import a Workflow with APs, e.g. from the Activity Library, into
an existing project, inconsistencies may result.

For example, if

* the APs referenced in the Workflow does not exist in the project
* the imported APs have the same names as APs already existing in the
project that have a different data type

In such cases, you are notified about inconsistencies by means of a
dialog.

image:media\image10.png[Ein Bild, das Tisch enthält. Automatisch
generierte Beschreibung,width=484,height=272]

The dialog shows you all the affected APs and suggests a suitable action
(_Suggested Auto-Correction_). Either missing APs are added or, if APs
have the same name but a different data type, deleted.

You can accept the suggestions by clicking on _Proceed_. Click on
_Remove Parameters from Workflow_ to remove all the APs of the imported
Workflow. Clicking on _Cancel_ cancels the import of the Workflow.
