= Activity Parameters

The Action Step _Activity Parameters_ (Activity Parameter) allows you to map variables
that you can use not only in the Workflow, but also in the activities of
the business process and gateways. This allows the Activity Parameters to be exchanged
among the different elements. For example, the BPMN gateway uses the Activity Parameters
to decide which activity should be executed next.

Only one _Activity Parameters_ Action Step can exist in a process and it is automatically placed in the _Workflow Initialization_ section when creating a new Workflow.

== Defining Activity Parameters

To define the Activity Parameters:

. In the BPMN editor, click the *Business Process Initialization* (image:business-process-initialization-icon.png[The Business Process Initialization button, 2%, 2%]) button.
. Click *Activity Parameters*.
+
image:toolbox-activity-parameters-config.png[The Activity Parameters config window, 30%, 30%]
. In the Business Process Initialization window, click (image:add-icon.png[The Add icon, 2%, 2%] *Add New Parameter ...*).
+
image:business-process-initialization-window.png[The Business Process Initialization window, 75%, 75%]
. Select the Activity Parameter to add from the list.
+
image:add-new-parameters.png[The list of available activity parameters to add, 30%, 30%]
+
The following data types are available:
+
* Texts (_alphanumeric_)
* Integers (_integer_)
* Floating point values (_floating_-_point_)
* Boolean values (_boolean_)
* Lists (_array_)
* Log-in data (user account)
* Screen coordinates (coordinates)
* Browser Session ID (web session ID)
* AWS log-in data (AWS credentials)

You can enter a name, description, and a value for the parameters in the corresponding fields. Activity parameter names have the following requirements:

* The name consists of a combination of letters, numbers, and underscores.
* The name contains no special characters or spaces.
* The initial letter of the name is lower case.
* The name is unique.
+
You cannot use the same name multiple times for different variables.

The predefined values are test values that are only used for a local run
within RPA Builder. The variables are registered automatically
on RPA Manager when uploaded. There, you can modify the values of the
variables and define them differently, depending on the station on which
the Workflow is being executed. See xref:advanced-concepts-using-variables.adoc[Using Variables] for additional information.

Please note that the test value may change in the course of the BP due
to the possible assignment of new values. If the BP is started again,
the value will be reset to its initial value.

== Deleting Activity Parameters

To delete an Activity Parameter, click the *Delete* (image:delete-icon.png[The Delete icon, 2%, 2%]) button next to the Activity Parameter you want to delete.

image:business-process-initialization-window.png[The business process initialization window, 75%, 75%]

You can only delete an Activity Parameter if it is not being used in a Workflow. If the Activity Parameter is already connected to at least one Workflow, a pop-up message appears indicating that the parameter is still in use.
// the following message appears:

image:delete-activity-parameter-warning.png[A warning message showing that a parameter cannot be deleted because it is still in use, 60%, 60%]

All the Workflows in which the Activity Parameter is used are displayed. To delete the Activity Parameter, you must remove the connections in all Workflows.

== Changing the Name of an Activity Parameter

Activity Parameter names cannot be changed after creation. As soon as you close Wizard by clicking *OK*, the *Name* field remains grayed out and you can no longer change the name. You can still edit the fields
_Description_ and _Value_ at any time.

If you want to subsequently change the name, delete the Activity Parameter and
create it again with a new name. This only applies if the Activity Parameter is not
already being used in a process.

== Connecting Activity Parameters to a Workflow

To connect an Activity Parameter with a Workflow:

. Click the *Edit Variable Mappings* (image:pin-icon.png[The Edit Variable Mappings button, 2%, 2%]) button next to the Action Step for which you want to connect an Activity Parameter.
+
image:rpa-home::activity-workflow-ocr.png[The Activity Workflow window, 40%, 40%]
. Select the Activity Parameter you want to connect.
+
image:connect-activity-parameters.png[The Edit Variable Mappings window showing Activity Parameters, 50%, 50%]

The Wizard lists all Activity Parameters and you can connect them to the Workflows that support the available parameter types.

== Connecting Activity Parameters to a Gateway

To connect an Activity Parameter to a Gateway:

. In the BPMN editor, click any *Gateway* element in your model.
. In the menu that opens, click the *Set Condition Expression* (image:cogs-icon.png[The Set Condition Expression button, 2%, 2%]) button.
+
image:set-expression-condition.png[The BPMN editor showing the Gateway settings, 60%, 60%]
. In the Wizard that opens, click *Build Expression*
+
image:set-expression-condition-for-gateway.png[The Set Condition Expression for Gateway window, 60%, 60%]
. Click *Add Expression* and build an expression by using the available Activity Parameters.

== Properties

* *Misc*
** *Write Variables to Log File / Run Protocol*
+
If this option is enabled, the variable names and their values are written to the log file
and the run protocol.

For security reasons, passwords are not shown in the user account data.
Simply leave this option disabled if the variables or their values contain confidential data.

== Inbound Variables

The Action Step _Activity Parameters_ does not have any inbound
variables.

== Outbound Variables

The Action Step _Activity Parameters_ does not have any outbound
variables.

== Wizard

image:activity-parameters-wizard.png[The Activity Parameters Wizard, 75%, 75%]

Click to select the desired parameters from the _Available Parameters_ column. You can use the arrows to drag them into the _Used in this Workflow_ column and thereby insert them into the Workflow.

For more information about the *Write Variables to Log File /Run Protocol* option, see <<Properties>>.

== Handling Inconsistencies When Importing a Workflow

Importing a Workflow with Activity Parameters, for example from the Activity Library, into
an existing project can cause inconsistencies.

For example, if:

* the Activity Parameters referenced in the Workflow do not exist in the project
* the imported Activity Parameters have the same names as Activity Parameters already existing in the
project that have a different data type

In such cases, RPA Builder notifies these inconsistencies by showing a dialog.

image:inconsistent-activity-parameters.png[The Inconsistent Activity Parameters dialog, 60%, 60%]

The dialog shows you all the affected Activity Parameters and suggests a suitable action
(_Suggested Auto-Correction_). Either missing Activity Parameters are added or, if Activity Parameters
have the same name but a different data type, deleted.

You can accept the suggestions by clicking on _Proceed_. Click on
_Remove Parameters from Workflow_ to remove all the Activity Parameters of the imported
Workflow. Clicking on _Cancel_ cancels the import of the Workflow.
