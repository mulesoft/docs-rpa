== File Controlled Loop

This _Flow Control Element_ reads data from a CSV file. The data is then
made available as variables (see Section link:#UsingVariables[Using
Variables]), whereby each column represents one variable. During
execution, the _File controlled Loop_ will iterate over each row of data
and run through all its contents for each row individually.

The file you use must be a valid, well-formatted CSV file that uses
semicolons as a delimiter. This means that all rows need to have the
same number of columns, separated by semicolons. If the file differs
from this format, an error will occur. Also, the first line is
considered the "header line". These headers will be used as variable
names and will not be used as actual variable values.

=== Properties

* *External File*
** *Import Filename* The full path of the file that is imported
** *Relative to 3rd Party Folder* Decides whether or not the file should
be loaded from the 3rd party folder
** *Shuffle* Shuffles the data rows during execution
* *Miscellaneous*
** *Iteration Count* If _Limit iterations_ is selected, this limits the
maximum iteration count used by the loop. Only applicable when the file
is imported at runtime.
** *Limit iterations* Decides whether iteration count is limited or not.
Only applicable when the file is imported at runtime.
** *Separate File Path for Execution* When _Use separate File Path for
Execution_ is selected the file will be read from this path instead of
the path given in _Import Filename_. Only applicable when the file is
imported at runtime.
** *Use separate File Path for Execution* Select this setting to load
the file from a different path during execution. Useful if you want to
read the file from a network location. Only applicable when the file is
imported at runtime.
** *Use type string only* Converts *all* data to type String during
runtime. In the wizard you can convert the data per column.

=== Inbound Variables

The Action Step File Controlled Loop has no properties.

=== Outbound Variables

Within the _Action Steps File Controlled Loop_ the respective column
contents are returned as variables.

The names of the variables follow the pattern [Action Step name].[column
name].

=== Wizard

When you first open the wizard, you need to decide whether to import the
file now or during execution – the wizard will have a different
appearance depending on this decision.

The main difference between the two modes is that when you import the
file at design time you can use its variables in timers and the data is
fixed. If you import the file during execution, you can read the file
from anywhere – including network locations. This allows you to alter
the data without touching the _Workflow_ at all (however you cannot use
the variables within timer names).

You can switch between the two modes, although you will lose all
previously defined variable mappings when you switch. When importing the
file during execution, you may also use variables within the column
filters; however any filters that contain variables will be deleted if
you switch mode.

=== Importing a File at Design Time

generierte Beschreibung,width=535,height=385]

If you select _Read file at design time_, the wizard looks like it does
above.

First, you need to import a CSV file by clicking _Import File_
image:media\image2.png[image,width=104,height=24]. _X1 Design Studio_
will then read and analyze your file and display a content preview in
the lower part of the wizard. You can then apply filters to each column
by clicking image:media\image3.png[image,width=22,height=22].

When you enter text in the _Filter_ field, all rows that do not contain
that text will be filtered out and only rows that match will be used.

With the help of the drop-down menu below the respective column name you
can change the type of the column content to type string and back to the
original type.

=== Importing a File during Execution

image:media\image6.png[image,width=416,height=300]

When you wish to import a file during execution, the wizard looks
slightly different. First, instead of an _Import File_ button, you have
a normal edit field where you can use environment variables and relative
paths. You can also define a different path for execution if the file
you want to use is in a different location on your executing system
compared to the computer you design the Workflow on. You can also limit
the maximum number of rows used and use inline variables within column
filters.
