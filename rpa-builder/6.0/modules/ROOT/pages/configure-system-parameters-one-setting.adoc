== Changing the Most Important System Parameters with One Setting

_Microsoft WindowsÂ®_ has a general performance setting for visual
effects that will turn off all settings relating to picture search at
the same time. We *strongly recommend* adjusting this setting for all
client systems and all systems used to create __Workflow__s. Simply go
to System Properties on the tab Advanced.

If not selected, switch to the _Visual Effects_ tab and set the radio
button to _Adjust for best performance._
