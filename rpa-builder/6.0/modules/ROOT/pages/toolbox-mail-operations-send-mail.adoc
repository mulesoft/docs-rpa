just as with other e-mail programs.

You can only use the Send Mail Action Step within a Mail Session. You
enter the information required for the connection to the mail server in
the Mail Session.

The wizard is split into two tabs, *Message* and *Attachment*.

In the Message area, you can enter free text under *Body*. You can also
link the content with *Insert Available Variables*. You have defined the
variables in advance either using the Activity Parameters or the
Workflow Based Variables.

The pin variable
//with image:media\image2.png[image,width=217,height=19]in the attachments area
is only displayed if you have defined a variable
of type Bool using the Activity Parameters or the Workflow Based Variables.

In the Attachment area, you can add up to three attachments to the
e-mail. Under Directory path, you define the path to the new file to be
created. You can create an absolute path or a path relative to the _Base Path_.
//using the buttons image:media\image3.png[image,width=141,height=17] and image:media\image4.png[image,width=108,height=18].
The default value is %STWS_BASEPATH%. Select an existing path.
//using the button image:media\image5.png[image,width=18,height=18].
To construct the path, you can also insert variables from the workflow.
//To do this, click on the pin image:media\image6.png[image,width=17,height=24]and select one
//of the variables available.
