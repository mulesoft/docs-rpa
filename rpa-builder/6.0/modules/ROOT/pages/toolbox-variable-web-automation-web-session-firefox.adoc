* *Accept untrusted certificates* (_Properties_ grid only)
+
When set, Firefox automatically accepts untrusted certificates.
* *Additional profile extensions* (_Properties_ grid only)
+
Use this setting to add additional Firefox configuration settings. One or more
settings have to be in the form of: `<config_1>;<type>;<value-1>;<config_n>;<type>;<value_n>`
+
For example: `intl.accept_languages;string;no,en-us,en`
+
Valid types are `int`, `bool`, and `string`. Values containing `;` must be enclosed in double
quotation marks `"`.
* *Alternative user agent string* (_Properties_ grid only)
+
Override the default User Agent string for Firefox.
* *Enable native events* (_Properties_ grid only)
+
Enable this option if you are having trouble with mouse hover during execution.
* *Port* (_Properties_ grid only)
+
Defines the TCP/IP listener port number used for Firefox for communication between Firefox and a
_ServiceTrace®_ robot. If set to `-1` an ephemeral port number is used
(and may also be used for all concurrent _MultiTracer_ instances).
+
To ensure optimal operation in a _MultiTracer_ environment, set it to `0`.
In this case, the port used is calculated by the following function:
_port = TSID * 4 + 45000_ (TSID is the current Terminal Session ID). To
choose a base value other than `45000`, a value greater than `0` must be
assigned.
* *Prefer 64Bit Webdriver*
+
Select your preferred bitness here. The program tries the other one in case the preferred one is not available
and generates a warning.
* *Profile name* (_Properties_ grid only)
+
Start Firefox with a specific profile. This profile must be created beforehand on the executing agent
using the Firefox profile manager.

session.
