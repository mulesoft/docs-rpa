== Website Load Time

The _Website Load Time_ Action Step measures the time taken to load a
website and the websites that it references. Referenced websites are
websites that are embedded within a website and loaded automatically at
the same time, e.g. visitor counters, analysis pages, Web stores,
integrated payment systems, etc.

The _Website Load Time_ Action Step logs all data measured in a special
file, identified by a .har extension (har = Http ARchive). This file is
located in Windows under "My Documents -> NameOfWorkflowStudioProject ->
Robot -> trace -> http@www-website-xx.har“. The name of the .har file is
derived from the website tested (e.g. http@www-wikipedia-de.har). The
file is overwritten every time the _Workflow_ is executed.

You can display the .har file using a suitable viewer. The viewer will
show the load times of all website components in a waterfall diagram.
There are many free viewers for .har files. The following list is not
comprehensive:

* http://www.softwareishard.com/har/viewer/
* http://phantomjs.org/network-monitoring.html
* http://yslow.org/

Show the content of the waterfall file using a viewer, e.g.
softwareishard, as described below:

[arabic]
. Open the .har file in an ASCII editor, e.g. Notepad++.
. Select all using <CTRL> + <a> and copy the entire content of the file
to the clipboard using <CTRL> + <c>.
. Start the viewer, e.g. softwareishard, in a browser.
. Paste the content of the clipboard into the input field on the website
using <CTRL> + <v>
. Click the <Preview> button.
. The next page of softwareishard, which is on the "Preview" tab, shows
the waterfall diagram of your measurement. The components of the website
of interest are shown on the left of the page and the load times are
shown on the right. The following example shows the waterfall diagram
for the website www.wikipedia.de.

Error message: FAIL to load the address. The error message "FAIL to load
the address" will be recorded in the .har log file if the _Website Load
Time_ Action Step was unable to load the specified URL.

It is also possible to perform further processing on the measured values
for _Website Load Time_ using the _Website Load Time.Result_ variable.
This variable has the same content as the .har file after the _Action
Step_ has been executed.

=== Properties

*Load Time Settings*

* [#AS_WebsiteLoadTime_P_WebsiteURL .anchor]####**WebsiteUrl** Enter the
URL to be tested, e.g. www.wikipedia.de.

Other Properties that are the same in all Action Steps in the _Web
Automation_ are described in the section on
link:#CommonProperties_WebAutomation[Common Properties.] For reasons of
clarity they are not shown here.

=== Inbound Variables

link:#AS_WebsiteLoadTime_P_WebsiteURL[*Website Url*]

=== Outbound Variables

*Result* The _Website Load Time.Result_ variable provides the results of
the load time measurement in the form of a log (the log has the same
content as the .har file).

*IsOnline* The _Website Load Time.IsOnline_ variable records whether the
website tested was available or not (True/False).

=== Wizard

* *WebsiteUrl* Enter the URL to be tested, e.g. www.wikipedia.de. The
URL can also be constructed by inserting variables from the _Workflow_.
To do this, click on the
image:media\image2.PNG[image,width=17,height=24] pin and select the
available variables from the _Test Master Data_ area or use the
_BasePath_ variable.

Error message: FAIL to load the address. The error message "FAIL to load
the address" will be recorded in the .har log file if the _Website Load
Time_ Action Step was unable to load the specified URL.
