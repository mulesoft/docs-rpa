You can use the _REST Call Action Step_ to fetch data directly from a
server and to collect the required information in a simple way.

You define the end point as you wish and you can assign parameters or
process variables to the call. This enables you to flexibly address any
REST interface. The response in JSON format (or XML) can be used as a
source variable during the remainder of the process run.

== REST Call via a proxy

You can also make the REST Call via a proxy server. To do this, the REST
Call Action Step automatically retrieves the necessary information from
the Network Settings, provided you have made the appropriate settings
there.

The Network Settings can be found in the Settings Action Step, which is
located in the Workflow Initialization block.

////
For more information about the settings options, see chapter 2.6.5
Settings.

== Properties

*REST Call Settings*

*Base Url* Here, the end point entered in the wizard is displayed.

*Json Path* Displays the JsonPath Expression, such as $.access_token.

*Method Type* REST guidelines
recommend the user of a specific HTTP method for a specific type of
calls to the server.

//image:media\image1.png[Ein Bild, das Tisch enthält. Automatischgenerierte Beschreibung,width=103,height=123]

*Parse Type* You can choose between JsonPath and XPath.

With both types, you have the major advantage that you can extract
exactly the information that you require without having to use special
scripting. This simplifies further processing for you as you can access
the desired result immediately.

With the _Json Query_ Action Step, you also have the
option of reading individual values from the Json object and thus
specifying the result further.

*Request body* Here you can see what is to be sent.

*Request Body Type* Here you can choose between _JSON_ and _Form URL
encoded._

*Url Extension* A path parameter that uniquely identifies the resource.

*XPath* Displays the Xpath expression, for example, /root/access_token/text().

== Inbound Variables

//link:#AS_RestCall_P_BaseUrl[*Base Url*]
*Base Url* Here, the end point entered in the wizard is displayed.

//link:#AS_RestCall_P_UrlExtension[*Url Extension*]
*Url Extension* A path parameter that uniquely identifies the resource.

//link:#AS_RestCall_P_JsonPath[*JsonPath Expression*]
*Json Path Expression* Displays the JsonPath Expression, such as $.access_token.

//link:#AS_RestCall_P_XPath[*XPath Expression*]
*XPath Expression* Displays the Xpath expression, for example, /root/access_token/text().

== Outbound Variables

*IsSuccessful* (boolean) Shows whether the REST Call was successful or not.

*ResponseBody* (string) Returns the requested information as a string.

*FirstItem* (array) The first element of the array is output as a string

*Status* (integer) Displays the HTTP status code. 200 for OK, for
example – the request was processed successfully and the result was
transferred in the answer

*ArrayCount* Indicates the number of elements of the returned array.

== Wizard

The wizard is split into the **Settings a**nd *Parameters* areas.

In *Settings*, you specify the *Method Type*, that is, the required HTTP method. In the *Base Url*, you
specify the Host and Base Path. With the *Url Extension*, you uniquely
identify the resource.
You can either just type in the URL or define it via the pin variable.
//image:media\image2.png[image,width=16,height=20].

//image:media\image3.png[image,width=604,height=25]

In the *Parameters* area, you provide the required information to the
end point. There are various options for this, you can enter the
parameters directly in the URL, similar to the example above, or you can
transfer them “invisibly” with the different parameters _Request Body_,
_Header Parameter_ or _Query Parameter_.

With the *Request Body*, you send data to the server, including, for
example, the form of communication between the server and the client.
According to convention, the methods GET, HEAD and DELETE do not require
a body (see also the network protocol RFC 7231).

In addition, in the Parameters area, on the left of the screen, you can
find the mapped variables and their *Test Values.* The mapping is
carried out via the Pin variable.
//image:media\image4.png[image,width=15,height=21].
With the Test Values,
you can check if the REST Call runs successfully. To do this, having
entered all the data, click on *_Send_* at the bottom right of the
wizard.

The (real) values of the mapped variables are not effective until the
production run of the Workflow.

//image:media\image5.png[image,width=315,height=87]

To insert the variables with the test values, click

[arabic]
. on the required position, e.g. in the area _Request body with
variables_
. on the right, on the relevant variable (\{A}, \{B}, \{C},... ). The
variable is then inserted at this position

//image:media\image6.png[Ein Bild, das Text enthält. Automatischgenerierte Beschreibung,width=213,height=183]

In the upper area, the body is displayed with the contained variables,
in the lower area, it is displayed with the broken down variables of the
Json object. If you selected Json, the body is also highlighted for an
improved overview.

With the selection option *Json* or *Form URL Encoded*, you can choose
which type of request and answer is to be accepted by the server and
client. At the same time, the system checks if your entries are
compliant. You can also view the conversion of Json to form URL Encoded
under the header Parameters in the content type.

With the *Header Parameter*, you describe exactly which resource is
collected or which answer format is required. User-defined headers can
be added with the ' X-’ prefix, for example, x-Customer – Customer ID.
Here, you typically provide the login information for authentication of
a user to a server.

//image:media\image7.png[image,width=317,height=55]

With the *Query Parameter*, you filter the resource and you can add
further information such as login information.

//image:media\image8.png[image,width=331,height=85]

In the *Result Viewer*, in the text results, you can view the entire
returned body, and in the parsed results, you can view the result
specified with JsonPath or Xpath.

== Example

In this example, login data is called up from a server via REST Call.
