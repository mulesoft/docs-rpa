The _File Check_ Action Step allows you to check whether a file exists
or not. You can evaluate the result using the _File Check.Check
Succeeded_ variable and use it in the later stages of the workflow.

Please note: Before the process starts, the specified _Directory Path_
is checked against the _Allowed Paths_. If the _Directory Path_
specified in the Action Step is not allowed, the workflow is cancelled
and an error message displayed. For further information, see the
*Settings* chapter.

== Properties

*File Operation Settings*

* *Directory path* Path to
the directory in which you want to search for the file. You can enter
the path either as an absolute or relative path. If you enter it as a
relative path, the path refers to the _Base Path_ variable.
* *File Check mode* Here,
you can specify what is to be searched for. In other words, whether the
file exists or not.
** *File exists* (default) If you have selected this mode, the Action
Step checks whether the file exists. If it does not exist, the workflow
is interrupted and an error message is displayed.
** *File not exists* Here, a check is carried out to establish whether
the file does *not* exist. If it does exist, the workflow is also
interrupted and an error message is displayed.
* *File Name* Here, you can
enter the name of the file you are searching for.

Placeholders are not allowed. For further instructions, please observe
the section *Invalid Characters*.

You will find further properties, which are the same for all Action
Steps, in the chapter *Common Properties*. These
are not detailed here for the sake of clarity.

== Inbound Variables

*Directory path* Path to
the directory in which you want to search for the file. You can enter
the path either as an absolute or relative path. If you enter it as a
relative path, the path refers to the _Base Path_ variable.

*File Name* Here, you can
enter the name of the file you are searching for.

== Outbound Variables

*Check Succeeded* This variable specifies whether the check was
successful or not (True/False).

*File Name* Gives the name of the file to be found.

*Directory Path* Gives the path used.

== Wizard

//You can use the link:#AS_FileCheck_P_DirectoryPath[Directory path] to
Define the path to the file to be found. You can create an absolute path
or a path relative to the _Base Path_.
//using the image:media\image1.png[image,width=175,height=22] and
//image:media\image2.png[image,width=130,height=22] buttons.
The initial
value is %STWS_BASEPATH%. Select an existing path
//using the
//image:media\image3.png[image,width=20,height=20] button.
You can also
insert variables from the workflow to create the path. To do this, click
the pin and select one of the available variables.

You will find further information on environment variables (Insert
Environment Variable) and script variables (Insert Script Variable) in
the *Settings* chapter.

In the *File name* field, enter the name of
the file to be found. You can also insert the _File Name_ using a
variable from the workflow. To do this, click the pin and select one of
the available variables. You then use the *Check mode* to define the result that
is to be searched for.
