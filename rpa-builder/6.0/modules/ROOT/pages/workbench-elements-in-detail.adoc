= Workbench Elements in Detail

The Workbench contains a graphical representation of a Workflow. The Workflow type shows as a watermark in the upper right corner.
The Workbench is capable of holding several windows as tabs, which enables you to work on more than one project at a time. Hold the mouse pointer over a tab for a short time and the path to the folder where the project is stored shows as a tooltip.

To select more than one object, press and hold _Ctrl_ or _Shift_ while clicking to select the objects. If you drag an object into the Workbench, it is automatically selected.

== Context Menu Options

The following list includes the context menu elements and describes each of them.

* *Disable/Enable*
+
Use this option to disable an Action Step and prevent its execution or to enable an Action Step that was previously disabled. Disabled Action Steps show greyed out on the workbench.
* *Enable All Selected/Disable All Selected*
+
Use this option to disable or enable multiple Action Steps simultaneously.
* *Save As Template*

Saves the selected Action Step with all settings as a template which you can use again later. See xref:managing-user-templates.adoc[Managing User Templates] for additional details about creating, importing, and exporting Templates.
* *Select all steps of same type*

Selects all Action Steps of the same type as the one you have clicked on. This option enables you to change the properties of these Action Steps uniformly.

Shows all incoming Pin variables associated with this Action Step. Click on the name of a variable to select on the Workbench the Action Step that populates that variable.

Enables you to rename the selected element.
