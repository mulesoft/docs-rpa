== Modifying the User Interface

With the exception of the menu bar, all areas can be resized and
positioned anywhere in the graphical user interface (GUI). Simply click
on the title bar of the view you wish to move and drag the frame. It is
possible to position the frame anywhere in the GUI by dropping it onto
the positioning icons which appear when a frame is moved.

For example, drag the _Workflow Outline_ tab and drop it onto the
positioning icon on the far right-hand side:

The _Workflow Outline_ is now docked to the right-hand edge:

You can also show any view as a standalone window. Again, start dragging
a view by its title bar, but instead of dropping it onto a positioning
icon, simply drop it anywhere else:

Furthermore, every frame can be hidden to make more working space
available. +
To hide a frame, click on the pin icon in its title bar:

Hidden frames are accessible via the tabs located on the edges of the
screen closest to their position before hiding. Move the mouse cursor
over the tab and the frame will slide in again:
