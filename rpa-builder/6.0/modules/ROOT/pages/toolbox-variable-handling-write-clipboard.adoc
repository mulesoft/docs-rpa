Use _Write Clipboard_ to copy a piece of text to the clipboard. This
will replace the content s of the clipboard with the text. This is
similar to the copy function, `<Ctrl>`+`<C>`, used in a text editor to copy
a selected piece of text, but in this case a value from the _Workflow_
is used for the clipboard instead of selected text. You can either enter
the text used by _Write Clipboard_ yourself, or use the value of a
variable.

== Properties

_Write Clipboard_ has no special properties.

Other Properties that are the same in all Action Steps are described in
the section on *Common Properties*.

== Inbound Variables

*Clipboard Text* Enter the text that should be copied to the clipboard
when this _Action Step_ is executed. You can also transfer the content
of a _Workflow_ variable to the clipboard. To do so, click on the pin
and select one of the available variables.

== Outbound Variables

*Write Clipboard*Â The _Write Clipboard.ClipboardText_ variable provides
the text to be written to the clipboard.

== Example

_Write Clipboard_ can be useful in transactions and robotic applications
when it is necessary to enter text quickly. This might be necessary, for
example, when an article description or a password has to be entered
automatically into a field. Another use for this function might be to
transfer data (text) from application 'A' to GUI 'B'.
