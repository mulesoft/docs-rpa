= Write to Excel File

Use the _Write to Excel File_ Action Step if you want to write the
content you have read from an Excel file using the _Read from Excel
File_ Action Step either to the same or a different destination file.

The _Write to Excel File_ Action Step can only be used inside an Excel
Session. Specify the destination file in the xref:toolbox-excel-operations-excel-session.adoc[Excel Session].

== Properties

*Excel Operation Settings*

* *Add Sheet name if doesn't exist* If you select the checkbox here, the
sheet will be created new if it does not already exist.
* *Column* This is where you enter the column to which you are writing. You can enter letters or
numbers in this field. If you enter a number, this will correspond to
the number of the column in the Excel file.
** Example: Instead of A for column A, you can enter a 1 for column A, a
2 for column B (instead of the letter B), and so on.

* *Overwrite content* This is where you determine whether a cell, row or
column which already has content is overwritten with new content.
* *Range* (drop-down selection, default: Cell) There are three different
modes available:
** *Cell* If you select _Cell_, the text will be written to a specific
cell.
** *Row* If you select _Row_, the text will be written to a specific row.
** *Column* If you select _Column_, the text will be written to a
specific column.
* *Row* This is where you enter the precise cell or row number to which text is to be written.
* *Sheet name* Name of the spreadsheet. Under Properties you can only enter the name directly,
unlike in the _Write to Excel File_ <<Wizard>>.
* *Text to write* This is where you enter the free text that will populate the cell, row or column.
* *Write value as* Here you can see whether the data in a cell is
written as text or number.

== Inbound Variables

* *Sheet name* Name of the spreadsheet.

* *Column* This is where you enter the column to which you are writing. You can enter letters or
numbers in this field. If you enter a number, this will correspond to
the number of the column in the Excel file.
* *Row* This is where you enter the precise cell or row number to which text is to be written.
* *Text to write* This is where you enter the free text that will populate the cell, row or column.
* *Array to write* This variable is only used in Row and Column mode. It accepts an array as well as a string in CSV format.

== Outbound Variables

*IsWritten* (Bool) This is how you check whether the text has been
successfully written to a specific cell, row or column. The result is
_True_ if the text was written successfully to the destination file.

== Wizard

The *Sheet name* field is for
selecting the spreadsheet to which text should be written. You can type
directly into the input field, select an existing sheet from the
drop-down list or connect with a Pin Variable. The drop-down list
contains all the sheets saved within the Excel file.

If you add a checkmark next to *Add sheet if it doesn't exist*, the
sheet will be created new if it doesn't already exist. You can also
connect here with a Pin Variable.

In *Excel Mode* you specify via the drop-down list whether to write to a
cell, a row or an entire column. You can enter letters or numbers as a
value or connect with a Pin Variable.

Under Write value as you specify whether the data in a cell is to be
written as text or number. This function is only active if you have
selected the Cell mode under Excel mode.

This is useful to avoid errors in calculations. If you enter a number
and select Write value as *Number*, the value is treated as a number in
the Excel sheet. The original formatting of the cell in the target file
is retained.

In the *Text to write* field you can enter free text which is to be
written to the Excel file or you can insert text via a Pin Variable.
*Text to write* appears if you have selected *Cell* mode. In the Row and
Column modes you will find the option *Array to write* at this point.

Selecting the checkbox next to *Overwrite content with text* will
overwrite a pre-populated cell, row or column with new content. You can
also connect here with a Pin Variable.
