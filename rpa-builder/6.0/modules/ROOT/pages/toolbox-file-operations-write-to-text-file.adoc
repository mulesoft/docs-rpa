*File Operation Settings:*

* *Add new line* Specify here whether a new line should be added after
the new text.

be created if the specified file does not exist. This option prevent the
_Workflow_ from ending with an error message if the file does not exist.
* *Directory path*
Enter the path to the directory where the file to be written to is
stored. You can specify an absolute or relative path. If a relative path
is used, then the path refers to a storage location relative to the
_Base Path_ variable.
* *File name* Enter the name of the file that is to be written.

be written. If this option is not selected, the new text will be
appended at the end of the existing text.
