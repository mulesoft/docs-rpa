== Excel Operations

=== Excel Controlled Loop

You can read data from an Excel table with the _Excel Controlled Loop_
element. It works in a similar way to the
File Controlled Loop and also forms the
framework for other Action Steps. The wizard provides you with numerous
setting options for determining the start (Read mode) and the end
(Terminate loop) of the iteration.

You can only use the _Excel Controlled Loop_ Action Step within an Excel
session. You enter the source file in the Excel Session.

==== Properties

*Excel Operation Settings*

* *Column* The Excel sheet is read from this column.
* *Empty rows count for break* Specifies the number of consecutive empty
rows that the loop is to be terminated after.
* *End column* The sheet is read up to this column.
* *End row* Here, you can specify exactly the row that the sheet is to
be read to.
* *Has a header* Indicates whether you have selected the option. If you
select this, the first row of the source file is used as the column
header.
* *Maximum number of rows* Specifies the maximum number of rows that are
to be read.
* *Only read a maximum number of rows* If you select this, you can
restrict the number of rows to be read.
* *Read mode* Here, you can see the selected read mode.
* *Regex condition for break* Shows the regular expression that the
iteration is to be stopped from.
* *Regex condition for first cell* Shows the regular expression that the
Excel sheet is to be read from.
* *Row* Specifies the row that the Excel sheet is to be read from.
* *Sheet name* Name of the spreadsheet. In the properties, you can only
enter the name directly. In the wizard, however, you can select the
spreadsheet directly or via the pin variable.
* *Stop (loop break) criterion* Here, you can see the selected
termination criterion (Terminate Loop)

==== Inbound Variables

* *Sheet name* Name of the spreadsheet. In the properties, you can only
enter the name directly. In the wizard, however, you can select the
spreadsheet directly or via the pin variable.
* *Column* The Excel sheet is read from this column.
* *Row* Specifies the row that the Excel sheet is to be read from.
* *Regex to match*

//link:\l[*Regex condition*]

==== Outbound Variables

The contents of each column are returned as variables within the _Excel
Controlled Loop Action Step_.

*Iteration Count* Number of loop cycles.

*RowNumber* Shows you the number of lines that will be read.

==== Wizard

Two settings are particularly important, *Read mode* and *Terminate loop*.

In *Read mode*, the read area is defined, i.e. the area which the data
from a spreadsheet is to be read in. Everything outside of this area is
not read and not analyzed.

The following options are provided:

* *Read entire sheet* (default) The entire spreadsheet is read
* *Start reading from row and column* Here, you specify the exact column
and row that reading is to begin from.

//image:media\image1.png[image,width=322,height=53]
* *Read part of sheet* In contrast, here you can not only specify where
reading is to begin from but also the point that reading should terminate at.

//image:media\image2.png[image,width=311,height=69]
* *Read to row* Here, you can specify the row that the spreadsheet is to be read to.

//image:media\image3.png[image,width=320,height=62]
* *Read to column* Here, you can specify the column that the spreadsheet is to be read to.

//image:media\image4.png[Ein Bild, das Text enthält. Automatischgenerierte Beschreibung,width=369,height=60]
* *Start reading when condition matches* You also have the option of
determining the read area dynamically by using regular expressions here.
If, for example, you enter ^PLZ (= Regex), the Action Step reads the
spreadsheet from the cell in which the content starts with PLZ.

//image:media\image5.png[image,width=604,height=44]

In *Terminate loop*, the terminate conditions are defined, i.e. here you
have additional options for terminating the read operation.

* *On reaching the end of sheet area* (default) The read operation is
automatically terminated at the end of the Excel sheet.
* *On reaching empty rows* The operation is terminated as soon as a
particular number of consecutive empty rows has been reached.

//image:media\image6.png[Ein Bild, das Text enthält. Automatischgenerierte Beschreibung,width=440,height=48]
* *On Regex match in the cell value* Here, the end is determined
dynamically by defining a regular expression. In this example, the read
area ends as soon as the content of a cell begins with PLZ.
//image:media\image7.png[Ein Bild, das Text enthält. Automatischgenerierte Beschreibung,width=445,height=52]
* *Only read a maximum number of rows* Here, you can specify the maximum number of rows to be read.
//image:media\image8.png[image,width=265,height=54]

If you have already specified a read area in *Read mode*, or used the
*Only read a maximum number of rows* option to stipulate a maximum
number of rows, and have simultaneously defined a termination condition
under *Terminate loop*, the event that occurs first is executed.
////
If you click on the image:media\image9.png[image,width=52,height=24]
button on the bottom right of the wizard, the selected read area is
displayed as a preview. The first 20 rows are displayed as the maximum.
////
If nothing else has been selected, the column headers are generated
automatically (Column_1, 2, 3 etc.).

//image:media\image10.png[Ein Bild, das Text enthält. Automatischgenerierte Beschreibung,width=528,height=236]

If you have selected the *Has a header* option in the wizard,
the first row is used as the column header.

//image:media\image11.png[Ein Bild, das Text enthält. Automatischgenerierte Beschreibung,width=528,height=227]

The data type of each column is recognized automatically.
//However, it is easy to change.
