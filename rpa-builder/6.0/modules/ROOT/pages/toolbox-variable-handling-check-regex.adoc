== Check Regex

Use the _Check Regex_ Action Step to search for a text fragment using a
regular expression. The text fragment can be searched for in a variable.

The results of _Check Regex_ provide various Outbound Variables that can
processed further in the _Workflow_.

An introduction to regular expressions is provided in the section on xref:advanced-concepts-using-regular-expressions.adoc[Using Regular Expressions].

=== Properties

*Check Regex Settings*

* *Input text* Enter the text that the regular expression is to be applied to. This property is only
displayed if no variable has been specified in the _Check Regex_ wizard as the target of the regular expression search.
* *Regex Pattern* Enter the regular expression that you want to use as the basis of the search.

Other Properties that are the same in all Action Steps are described in the section on *Common Properties*. For reasons of clarity they are not shown here.

=== Inbound Variables

//link:#AS_CheckRegex_P_RegexPattern[*Regex Pattern*]
*Regex Pattern* Enter the regular expression that you want to use as the basis of the search.

//link:#AS_CheckRegex_P_InputText[*Input text*]
*Input text* Enter the text that the regular expression is to be applied to. This property is only
displayed if no variable has been specified in the _Check Regex_ wizard as the target of the regular expression search.

=== Outbound Variables

*First Match* The_First Match.Check Regex_ variable stores the first
match found for the search expression. The text to be searched is read
from top to bottom and the first match is given as the output. The
output text is truncated to a maximum length of 1024 characters.

*IsMatched* The _IsMatched.Check Regex_ specifies whether the expression
searched for was found (True/False).

*Match Count* The _Match Count.Check Regex_ variable provides the number
of matches found in the text searched.

*Number of first line matched* The _Number of first line matched.Check
Regex_ provides the line number of the first line that contains the text
searched for.

=== Wizard

*Regex* Enter the regular expression that you want to use as the basis
of the search. Instead of entering the regular expression directly here,
you can store it in a variable. Use the pin next to the *Regex* field to
assign a variable.
////
Click the image:media\image1.png[image,width=21,height=20] button to open a dialog
for testing the regular expression. The regular expression already
specified in the *Regex* field will appear automatically in the _Regex Tester_ dialog.
////

The regular expression can be modified in the _Regex Tester_ dialog.
Enter the text that you want to use to test the regular expression into
the *Test Pattern* field. Click the *Execute Test* button to run the
test. Matches will be highlighted in the *Test Pattern* field. Click the
*Apply* button to transfer the tested regular expression to the _Check
Regex_ Action Step. Click the *Cancel* button to close the _Regex
Tester_ and discard any changes.

*Text Pattern* Enter the text that the regular expression should be
applied to. Use the Outbound Variables from _Check Regex_ to determine
if matches were found and what form the matches take. The _Text Pattern_
can either be entered directly or read from the content of a variable.
To read from a variable, click on the pin and select one of the
available variables.

*Please note the following with regard to error handling:* An error
message will be displayed if, for example, the Regex syntax is incorrect
or an internal error has occurred (e.g. API error). Conversely, if the
regular expression is correct but no matching content is found
(match=0), a warning message is displayed.
