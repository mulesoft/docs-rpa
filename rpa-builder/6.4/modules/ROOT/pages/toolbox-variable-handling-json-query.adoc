
= Json Query

Use the Json Query Action Step to parse Json objects and read individual values or elements from the object. The result remains available for the rest of the process run as a source variable.

Combine this Action Step with REST Call to further refine the resulting JSON output.

== Properties

* *JsonPath Expression*
+
The JsonPath expression. For example, `$.access_token`.

== Inbound Variables

* *Json Object* 
+
The Json object from which to extract the value using the JsonPath expression. You can select the result of a REST Call Action Step to serve as an object.

* *JsonPath Expression* 
+
The JsonPath expression to specify the value to extract from the object. For example, `$.ID`, to extract the value of element `ID` as a result.

== Outbound Variables

* *IsSucceeded* (boolean) 
+
Shows if the Action Step executed successfully or not.

* *FirstItem* (array) 
+
Outputs the first element of the array as a string.

* *ArrayCount* 
+
Indicates the number of elements of the returned array.

== Wizard

Use the Wizard to select the source JSON Object, usually an Inbound Variable containing the result of a REST Call, and to specify the JsonPath expression to extract values from the object. An empty result is a valid result and the process continues without considering it as an error.

Use the JsonPath expression Builder to simplify the process of creating the JsonPath expression. 

=== Build a JsonPath Expression

. Click the *Build JsonPath Expression* (image:jsonpath-expression-builder-button.png[3%, 3%, Build JsonPath Expression button]) button in the wizard to open the JsonPath Expression Builder tool.
. Click *Import from file* to explore and select a JSON file to open or paste the JSON directly in the textbox.

. Click *Next*.
. Click an object in the *JSON* panel to extract the object's JsonPath Expression. 
+

+
After clicking a JSON element, the *Result* panel updates to show what values the expression extracts and the *JsonPatch expression* field updates to show the expression built to extract the specified value. 
. Click *Apply* to confirm and use the built JsonPath expression.
