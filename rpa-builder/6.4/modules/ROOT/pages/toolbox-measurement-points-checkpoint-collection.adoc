= Checkpoint Collection

The Checkpoint Collection Action Step enables you to collect all timer values from the Checkpoint Action Steps configured in an Activity Workflow. 

Because all Checkpoint values are determined at the end of the workflow, you can only place this Action Step in the Workflow Finalization section.
