= Building JSONPath Expressions 

JSONPath expressions navigate through a JSON structure in a similar way that XPath expressions reference parts of an XML document. 

To simplify the process of creating JSONPath expressions, use the JSONPath Expression Builder included in RPA Builder. Open this tool by clicking (image:jsonpath-expression-builder-button.png[2.5%, 2.5%, Build JsonPath Expression button.]) in the top menu bar or inside Action Steps that support JSON expressions (JSON Query, REST Call, and AWS Action Steps). 

Opening the JSONPath Expression Builder from the top menu bar enables you to copy the resulting JSONPath expression for further use, instead of assigning it directly within an Action Step.

After clicking a JSON element, the *Result* panel updates to show what values the expression extracts and the *JSONPath expression* field updates to show the expression built to extract the specified value. 
. Click *Apply* to confirm and use the built JSONPath expression.
