= Read Mail

Use the _Read Mail_ action step, to read the mails from a mailbox. You can restrict the results using the filter function to simplify the search. All the contents of the read mail become available as outbound variables.  

This action step works similarly to the Excel Controlled Loop
and bundles other action steps, which enable you to further process the mails.

Read Mail works only within a Mail Session, where you specify the information required for the connection to the mail server.

The following filter functions are available:

* Body
* Mail info
* Read/ Unread
* Recipient (To:)
* Recipient (Cc:)
* Sender
* Subject
* Text Search

Read Mail supports the following encodings: UTF-8, UTF-16, Shift-JIS, and EUC-JP. 

== Properties

*Read Mail Settings*

*Attachment folder path* Path to the folder in which the attachments of the mails are saved.

*Body* Text to be contained in the body of the mail.

*Create attachment folder* If a checkmark is set here, a folder is
created if it did not already exist. In this folder, the attachments
from the mails are saved.

*Folder name* Name for the folder that is specified in the Read Mail action step under _Inbox Folder Name_.

You should ensure that the folder really exists in the mailbox you
specified in the Mail Session.

If you have selected the IMAP protocol in the Mail Session and you wish
to call up a subfolder of the inbox, you must always specify the
complete path under Folder Name, e.g. Inbox/MuleSoft/Alerts.

If the folder MuleSoft is on the same level as the _Inbox_, then
MuleSoft/Alerts would be sufficient as the path name.

Regardless of the language configured in your Outlook version, with IMAP, the path must always begin with `Inbox`.

POP3, however, does not support the folder structure in the inbox so you
cannot specify a folder there.

*Mail info* The ID of a specific mail that originates from a different Read Mail action step and can be
incorporated here as an inbound variable.

*Maximum emails to read* Displays the number of mails to be read. You can read up to 99 mails.

*Read* Only those mails that have already been read are displayed.

*Recipient (Cc:)* The recipient address is sought in the Cc.

*Recipient (To:)* The recipient address is sought.

*Save attachments* If the checkbox is selected, the attachments of the
mails that were found are saved in the specified folder. A separate
folder is generated for each mail. The path to this subfolder is
available as an outbound variable.

*Sender* The entered text is to be contained in the sender address.

*Sort mode* (Default: Newest first) Specifies the order in which the
found mails are sorted. You can choose between Newest first and Oldest
first.

*Subject* Here, the text is sought only in the subject of the mail.

*Text search* This text is sought in the entire mail.

*Unread* Only unread mails are displayed.
