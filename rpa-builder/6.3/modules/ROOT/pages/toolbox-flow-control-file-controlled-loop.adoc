This _Flow Control Element_ reads data from a CSV file and makes the data available as variables, whereby each column represents one variable. During
execution, _File Controlled Loop_ iterates over each row of data and runs through all the content of each row individually.

Ensure you use a valid and well-formatted CSV file where all rows have the same number of columns separated by the selected separation character. RPA Builder selects the semicolon (`;`) as the separation character when it converts existing workflows created with earlier versions. If the file has an incorrect format, _File Controlled Loop_ cannot read the file. 

The first line of the file is considered the header line. _File Controlled Loop_ uses these headers as variable names and not as actual variable values.

== Properties

* *External File*
** *Import Filename* 
+
Full path of the file to import.
** *Relative to 3rd Party Folder* 
+
Specifies if the path of the file to load is relative to the _3rd party_ folder.
** *Separation character*
+
Specifies the character to use as a column separator when reading the CSV file.
** *Shuffle* 
+
Shuffles the data rows during execution.
* *Miscellaneous*
** *Iteration Count* 
+
If *Limit iterations* is selected, this property specifies the
maximum iterations the loop does. Only applicable when the file
is imported at runtime.
** *Limit iterations* 
+
Decides whether the iteration count is limited or not.
Only applicable when the file is imported at runtime.
** *Separate File Path for Execution* 
+
When *Use separate File Path for Execution* is selected, _File Controlled Loop_ reads the file from this path instead of
the path given in *Import Filename*. Only applicable when the file is
imported at runtime.
** *Use separate File Path for Execution* 
+
Select this setting to load the file from a different path during execution. Useful if you want to
read the file from a network location. Only applicable when the file is
imported at runtime.
** *Use type string only* 
+
Converts all data to type String during runtime. In the wizard, you can convert the data per column.

== Inbound Variables

The Action Step File Controlled Loop has no Inbound variables.

== Outbound Variables

The Action Steps inside _File Controlled Loop_ return the respective column
contents as variables.

The names of the variables follow the pattern `<Action Step name>.<column name>`.

== Wizard

The wizard enables you to select whether to import the file at the moment or during execution. Depending on your selection, the wizard changes. 

The main difference between the two modes is that, when you import the
file at design time, you can use its variables in timers, and the data is
fixed. If you import the file during execution, you can read the file
from anywhere, including network locations, which enables you to alter the data without modifying the _Workflow_ at all (however, you cannot use
the variables within timer names).

If you switch between the two modes you lose all previously defined variable mappings. 

Importing the file during execution enables you to use variables within the column
filters. However, the wizard deletes any filters that contain variables if you switch modes.

=== Importing a File at Design Time

When you select *Read file now*, the wizard shows the following configuration options:

image::file-controlled-loop-wizard-read-file-now.png[The File Controlled Loop wizard showing the file preview when Read file now is selected, 75%, 75%]

Click *Import File* to select the file to import. RPA Builder then reads and analyzes the file and displays a content preview in
the *File Content Preview* section of the wizard. 

The *File Content Preview* section enables you to apply filters to each column by clicking the *Filter* button (image:filter-icon.png[The filter icon, 2%, 2%]). When you enter text in the *Filter* field, the preview filters out all rows that do not contain the specified text.

Select *Use Regex* to use a regular expression instead of plain text when applying filters. 

Use the drop-down menu next to each column name to change the type of the column content.

=== Importing a File During Execution

When you select *Read file dinamically during Workflow execution*, the wizard shows the following configuration options: 

image::file-controlled-loop-read-file-during-execution.png[The File Controlled Loop wizard showing the file preview when Read file dinamically during Workflow execution is selected, 75%, 75%]

Click *[...]* next to the *File Name* field to specify the file path, select and copy the file to the _3rd Party_ folder, or open the _3rd Party_ folder. 

Select *Use separate File Path during Script Execution* to specify an absolute path to read the file from. Use this option when the file's location differs in the system that executes the automation and the system where you build the Workflow. 

Select *Only read a maximum of <n> Records* and specify a number to limit the maximum number of rows to read from the file.
