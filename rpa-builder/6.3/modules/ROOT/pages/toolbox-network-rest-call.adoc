
= REST Call

Use the REST Call Action Step to fetch data directly from a
server and to collect the required information in a simple way.

Define the endpoint according to your needs and assign parameters or
process variables to the call, which enables you to flexibly address any
REST interface. You can use the response in JSON or XML format as a
source variable during the remainder of the process run.

== REST Call via a Proxy Server

To make REST calls via a proxy server:

image:configure-proxy-settings.png[75%, 75%, "The Settings option inside the Workflow Initialization block and the Network Settings configuration window."]

[calloutlist]
. From the *Workflow Initialization* block, open *Settings*.
. In the *Network Settings* tab, configure your proxy settings.  

The REST Call Action Step automatically retrieves the necessary information from the network settings.

For more information about the configurable settings, see xref:workflow-initialization.adoc#properties[Workflow Settings Properties].

== Properties

* *Authentication Options* 
** *API Key Authentication Key* 
+
The name of the API Key to use for authentication.
** *API Key Authentication Value* 
+
The value to use when using API Key authentication. 
** *Basic Auth Credentials*
+
The credentials to use when using Basic Authentication. 
** *REST Call Authentication Type* 
+
The type of authentication header to add to the call. Available values are: 
+
*** NoAuth
*** ApiKey
*** BearerToken
*** BasicAuth

* *REST Call Settings*

** *Base Url* 
+
The base URL of the service.

Specifies how to parse the REST call result.
+
You can choose between *JsonPath* and *XPath*. Both types enable you to extract the exact information that you require without having to use special
scripting, which simplifies further processing because you can access
the desired result immediately.
+
The _Json Query_ Action Step enables you to read individual values from the JSON object and process the result further.

** *Request body* 
+
The request body of the REST call to send. 

** *Request Body Type* 
+
The request body type of the REST call result. You can choose between *Json* and *Form URL encoded*.

** *Url Extension* 
+
A path parameter that uniquely identifies the resource.

** *XPath* 
+
The Xpath expression to the property of the response object. For example, `/root/access_token/text()`.

== Inbound Variables

* *Base Url*
+
The base URL of the service.
* *Url Extension*
+
A path parameter that uniquely identifies the resource.
* *Json Path Expression*
+
The JSON path to the property of the response object. For Example, `$.access_token`.
* *XPath Expression* 
+
The Xpath expression to the property of the response object. For example, `/root/access_token/text()`.

== Outbound Variables

* *IsSuccessful* 
+
(boolean) Shows whether the REST Call was successful.

* *ResponseBody* 
+
(string) Returns the requested information as a string.

* *FirstItem* 
+
(array) The first element of the array is output as a string.

* *Status* 
+
(integer) Displays the HTTP status code.
+
For example, `200` is OK, which means the request was processed successfully and the result was
transferred in the answer.

* *ArrayCount* 
+
The number of elements of the returned array.

== Wizard

The wizard is split into the *Settings* and *Parameters* areas.

=== Settings 

image:rest-call-wizard-settings.png[75%, 75%, The Settings section of the REST Call Wizard]

In *Settings*, you specify:

* *Method Type*: The required HTTP method. 
* *Base Url*: The Host and Base Path. 
* *Url Extension*: A unique identifier for the resource. You can type in the URL or define it via the pin variable. 
* *Parse Type*: The method for parsing the result. Available options are *JsonPath* and *XPath*.
* *JsonPath Expression*: The path to the property of the response object.

=== Parameters 

image:rest-call-wizard-parameters.png[75%, 75%, The Parameters section of the REST Call Wizard]

In the *Parameters* area, you provide the required information to the
end point. There are various options for this, you can enter the
parameters directly in the URL or you can configure the parameters using the following tabs: *Request Body*,
*Header Parameter*, *Query Parameter*, and *Authentication*.

==== Request Body 

With the *Request Body*, you send data to the server, including, for
example, the form of communication between the server and the client.
According to convention, the methods GET, HEAD and DELETE do not require
a body (see also the network protocol RFC 7231).

In the *Parameters* area you can
find the mapped variables and their *Test Values*. The mapping is
carried out via the Pin variable.

With the test values,
you can check if the REST call runs successfully. To do this, enter all of the data and click *Send* at the end of the
wizard.

The actual values of the mapped variables are not effective until the
production run of the Workflow.

//===== Inserting Variables Into the Request Body 
//image:media\image5.png[image,width=315,height=87]

To insert the variables with test values into the request body:

image:rest-call-wizard-parameters-variables.png[75%, 75%, The Request Body section of the REST Call Wizard]

[calloutlist]
. In the *Request body with variables* area, click the position where you want to insert the variable. 
. In the *Test Values* section, click on the variable you want to insert. For Example, `{A}: Activity Parameters.myVar`.

The *Request body with variables* section shows the body of the request and the contained variables. The *Request body with test values* section shows the body with the broken down variables of the
JSON object. If you selected JSON, the body is also highlighted for an
improved overview.

Select between *Json* or *Form URL Encoded* to choose
which type of request and answer is to be accepted by the server and
client. At the same time, the system checks if your entries are
compliant. Depending on the request body type you select, the `Content-Type` parameter updates automatically in the *Header Parameters* tab.

==== Header Parameter 

image:rest-call-wizard-header-parameter.png[75%, 75%, The Header Parameter tab of the REST Call Wizard]

With the *Header Parameter*, you describe exactly which resource is
collected or which answer format is required. You can add user-defined headers with the `x-` prefix, for example, `x-Customer` – `Customer ID`.
Here, you typically provide the login information for authentication of
a user to a server.

//image:media\image7.png[image,width=317,height=55]

==== Query Parameter 

image:rest-call-wizard-query-parameter.png[75%, 75%, The Query Parameter tab of the REST Call Wizard]

With the *Query Parameter*, you filter the resource and you can add
further information such as login information.

//image:media\image8.png[image,width=331,height=85]

==== Authentication

image:rest-call-wizard-authentication.png[75%, 75%, The Authentication tab of the REST Call Wizard]

The *Authentication* tab enables you to select the authentication type to add as a header and the corresponding credentials to use. 

The available authentication types are:

* *API Key*
* *Bearer Token* 
* *Basic Auth* 
* *None*

==== Result Viewer

In the *Result Viewer*, in the text results, you can view the entire
returned body, and in the parsed results, you can view the result
specified with JsonPath or Xpath.
