= Activity Library Explorer 

In the Activity Library Explorer you can view all the activity templates assigned to your organization. All users in your organization with the privilege *Activity Library Administration* have access to the same Activity Library.

If another user adds an Activity, you see the change after refreshing the Activity Library Explorer.

The Activity Library Explorer toolbar contains the following elements: 

* (image:activity-library-explorer-toolbar-refresh.png["The Refresh button.", 2%, 2%]) *Refresh*

Updates the contents of the Activity Library Explorer.

* (image:edit-icon.png["The Edit button.", 2%, 2%]) *Edit*
+
Opens the individual editing mode of an activity to make changes.
+
If you upload the activity after making changes, the Activity Library saves the updated activity as a new revision.

You can edit the Activities in the Activity Library regardless of which phase the Process that contains these activities is in.
* (image:activity-library-explorer-toolbar-show-log.png["The Show Log button.", 2%, 2%]) *Show Log*
+
Opens a window containing all revisions of the activity. You can select a revision and edit it by choosing *Edit* in the individual editing mode.
* (image:copy-icon.png["The Copy button.", 2%, 2%]) *Copy*
+
Creates a copy of the selected element, which shows in the Activity Library.
+
By default, this process copies all information such as name, description, and activity tags. During the upload, the Activity Library prefixes the activity name with _Copy of_. You can later edit this information as required. 
* (image:delete-icon-alt.png["The Delete from Library button.", 2%, 2%]) *Delete from Library*

Deletes the selected element from the Activity Library.

+
Opens a dialog that enables you to export an Activity Library Workflow from the Activity Library to your file system as a `(.calw)` package file.
+
When you export Activity Library workflows to a file, RPA Builder removes passwords and all sensitive information stored in wizards of Action Steps, User Account Variables, and Activity Parameters (for example secrets in OAuthCredentials or AWS Credentials) to prevent this information from being shared.
