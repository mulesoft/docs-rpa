activities, to arrange them more efficiently, and to subsequently find them more easily using the
search function in the Activity Library Explorer.

The name of the tag must be unique.

After you have created tags, you can assign them to a workflow when you upload the workflow to
the Activity Library by using the *Activity Tags* tab.
