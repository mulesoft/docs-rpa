= Activity Tags

Use Activity Tags to categorize the activities in the Activity Library, which enables you to manage the
activities, arrange them more efficiently, and subsequently find them more easily using the
search function in the Activity Library Explorer. 

== Create Activity Tags 

To create new Activity Tags: 

. In the Activity Library toolbar, click (image:activity-library-explorer-toolbar-manage-activity-tags.png["The Manage Activity Tags button.", 2%, 2%]) *Manage Activity Tags*.
. Click *Create New Activity Tag*. 
. Provide a descriptive name for the tag and click *OK*.

The name of the tag must be unique. 

[WARNING]
If you delete tags, they are removed automatically from all assignments.

After you create tags, you can assign them to a workflow when you upload the workflow to
the Activity Library by using the *Activity Tags* tab.
