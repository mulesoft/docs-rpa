= Stopwatch Collection

The Stopwatch Collection Action Step enables you to collect all timer values from the Stopwatch Action Steps configure in an Activity Workflow. 

Because all Stopwatch values are determined at the end of the workflow, you can only place this Action Step in the Workflow Finalization section.
