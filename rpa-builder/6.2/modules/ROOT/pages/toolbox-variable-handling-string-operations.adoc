The String Operations Action Step enables you to modify strings by using a variety of operations, including find and replace and trimming.

== Properties

* *Input Text* 
+
The string that you want to modify. 
+
Specify this value manually or use the wizard to define this value via the pin variable.
* *Use a regular expresion for string to find*
+
Select this option to evaluate the value specified in the *Input Text* field as a regular expression.  

== Inbound Variables

//link:\l[*Input text*]
* *Input Text* 
+
The string that you want to modify. 
+
Specify this value manually or by using the wizard to select a pin variable for the value.
* *StringToFind* 
+
The string to search for inside the *Input Text* string. 
* *StringToReplaceWith* 
+
The string to replace the found instances of *StringToFind*.
* *CharacterToTrimAt* 
+
The character to use as delimiter when using trim operations. 
* *NumberOfCharacters*
+
The number of characters to count when using trim operations. 

== Outbound Variables

* *Result* 
+
The modified string is output as the result. You can then use this string in subsequent Action Steps.

* *String operation* 
+
The string operation you want to perform. The following operations are available:

** *Analyse*
** *Find and replace text* 
+
Searches and replaces text found in the input text. For example: 
+
*** *Input text (string)* = `MyTESTString`
*** *Find what* = `TEST`
*** *Replace with* = `NEW`
*** Output = `MyNEWString`
** *Left (take first characters)*
+
Outputs the specified number of characters from the string, starting from the first character. For example: 
+
*** *Input text (string)* = `MyTESTString`
*** *Number of characters* = `4`
*** Output = `MyTE` 
** *Right (take last characters)*
+
Outputs the specified number of characters from the string, starting from the last character. For example: 
+
*** *Input text (string)* = `MyTESTString`
*** *Number of characters* = `4`
*** Output = `ring` 
** *Trim left (remove first characters)*
+
Removes the specified number of characters from the string, starting from the first character. For example: 
+
*** *Input text (string)* = `MyTESTString`
*** *Number of characters* = `3`
*** Output = `ESTString` 
** *Trim right (remove last characters)*
+
Removes the specified number of characters from the string, starting from the last character. For example: 
+
*** *Input text (string)* = `MyTESTString`
*** *Number of characters* = `3`
*** Output = `MyTESTStr` 
** *Takes first characters of the string until a specific character (specific character is not part of output)*
+
Outputs all characters between the beginning of the string and the first occurrence of the *Character to trim at*. For example: 
+
*** *Input text (string)* = `MyTESTString`
*** *Character to trim at* = `t`
*** Output = `MyTESTS` 
+
Note that the output string does not include the search character.
** *Takes last characters of the string until a specific character (specific character is not part of output)*
+
Outputs all characters between the end of the string and the first occurrence of the *Character to trim at*. For example: 
+
*** *Input text (string)* = `MyTESTString`
*** *Character to trim at* = `T`
*** Output = `String`
+
Note that the output string does not include the search character.
** *Removes first characters of the string until a specific character (specific character is not part of output)*
+
Removes all characters between the beginning of the string and the first occurrence of the *Character to trim at*. For example: 
+
*** *Input text (string)* = `MyTESTString`
*** *Character to trim at* = `T`
*** Output = `ESTString` 
+
Note that the search character is removed from the output string. 
** *Removes last characters of the string until a specific character (specific character is not part of output)*
+
Removes all characters between the end of the string and the first occurrence of the *Character to trim at*. For example: 
+
*** *Input text (string)* = `MyTESTString`
*** *Character to trim at* = `T`
*** Output = `MyTES` 
+
Note that the search character is removed from the output string.
