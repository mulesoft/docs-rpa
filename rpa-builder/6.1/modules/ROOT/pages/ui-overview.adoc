Most visual elements in RPA Builder have tooltips. If you
ever want to know what a button or setting does, hover your mouse
pointer over it for a few seconds.

== Menu Bar

The menu bar contains icons for saving, uploading, and
validating projects. The other icons are shortcuts to various views in
RPA Builder.

=== Tools

* *Open MuleSoft RPA Builder Log*
+
This menu item opens the RPA Builder
log file in your default text editor. The log is a text file containing
a chronological list of all relevant events since RPA Builder was
last launched. It also contains information about the executing system.

* *Open Regex Tester*
+
Use this dialog to create and test regular
expressions. You can also access the _Regex Tester_ directly from
various _Action Steps_. The section on Using Regular Expressions includes a
more detailed description of this dialog and of regular expressions in
general.

* *Templates Manager*
+
This menu item opens the _Templates Manager_. This
provides an overview of all the templates which have been created in RPA Builder already. Clicking the template name on the left-hand
side of the window opens a preview of that template’s content. Use the
_Delete_ button to delete individual templates. You can find out how to
create and edit templates in the section entitled Save selected Workflow Objects as
template.

image::rpa-builder-options-general.png[Option General, 50%, 50%]

* *Default Settings*
** *General timeout default for new projects*
+
If you want to use the same timeout for every _Action Step_ containing
this property, you can enter the value here.
+
A timeout is the time span an _Action Step_ waits before reporting an
error in case of failure.
+
This value is only used for initialization when creating a new project
and can be replaced within each _Action Step_ by a value that is valid
only for that _Action Step_.
+
If you want to change the default timeout value for a whole Workflow
which has already been created, please use the _Default Timeout [sec]_
setting in the _Workflow Properties_.

** *Save Projects and Settings in All Users Folder*
+
If this option is set, RPA Builder saves all projects, the most common
options, _Page Setup…_, and _Print Template Settings_
for the Printing of a Workflow into the folder
`C:\Users\Public\Documents\MuleSoft\RPA`. Otherwise, it saves the settings to the folder
`C:\Users\[UserName.Domain]\Documents\MuleSoft\RPA` of the respective
user.

** *Open last project on start*
+
Selecting this option means that the last
project that you opened is reloaded and displayed when you launch
RPA Builder.

==== Autosave

The *Autosave* options menu contains the following settings:

* *General Visibility*
** *Show Action Step descriptions*
+
(default: off) This option enables you to
show and hide the descriptions of individual Workflow elements on the
Workbench in RPA Builder. This does not affect the visibility
of the individual element descriptions for the Properties and tool tips,
which are always visible. This option can also be modified via the _Show
Action Step descriptions_ button or the CTRL+D shortcut. It is saved on
an individual user basis.

** *Show system parameters dialog*
+
If this option is set, the system parameters are shown whenever a
new Activity Workflow is created. These can also be shown via the menu
_View_ -> _Show System Parameters_.

== Explorer Pane

In the window pane on the left-hand side, you will find five tabs
containing the views _Toolbox_, _Project_, _Activity Library_,
_Repository_ and _Outline_.

If any of these views are not visible, you can always show them again by
using the View menu from the menu bar.

The *_Toolbox_* contains a list of all elements, such as _Action Steps_
and _Control Blocks_, which can be inserted in a _Workflow_.

Elements are organized in categories, so that you can find fitting ones
easily. By clicking on the star symbol next to an element, you can add
it to the category _Favorites_.

Elements can be inserted into the Workflow using Drag&Drop.

You can find a detailed description for each element in the xref:toolbox.adoc[Toolbox] section.

If you input text in the field _Filter_ the content of the _Toolbox_
is reduced successively to elements, the names of which contain
this text.

The filter is case-insensitive.


The *_Project_* tab contains a list of all loaded Workflows of a project. If you click on one of the Workflows, it is also displayed in the Workbench. This way
you can easily switch back and forth between Workflows

Right-clicking a Workflow opens the context menu providing additional
functions:

* *Edit Workflow Properties* Opens the Properties pane of the selected
Workflow
* *Clear Run Results marking* Clears the markings of warnings and errors
in the Workbench view of the selected project. These markings are shown
after a failed local Workflow run or after the import of an analysis
package.
* *Open Workflow Location* Opens the folder containing the selected
Workflow.

If you are using the Repository for storing your Business Process, the tab *_Repository Explorer_* shows a list of all available Business Process. These can be
downloaded for editing.

//Chapter Repository Explorer gives a detailed description of all functions.

If you use the *_Activity Library,_* you can view and delete all available
Activity Templates here.

//For a more detailed description of how to use the Activity Library, see the chapter Activity Library.

The *_Workflow Outline_* is a shortened view of the open Workflow.

You can double-click an element to mark it in the Workbench pane.

Right-clicking an element opens a context menu:

* *Run Wizard* Opens the Wizard of the selected element

* *Delete* Deletes the selected element
* *Expand all* Expands the view to show all elements, in the _Document
Outline_ as well as on the Workbench
* *Collapse all* Collapses the view to show only higher-level elements,
in the _Document Outline_ as well as on the Workbench

== Workflow Run Results

The _Workflow Run Results_ section shows detailed information on the
last Activity Workflow that was run.

See xref:running-workflows-and-using-workflow-run-results.adoc#workflow-run-results[The Workflow Run Results Panel] for additional details. 

== Project Status

The Project Status section provides detailed information about the
validation and script generation of the project.

== Workflow Properties Grid

The _Workflow_ _Properties_ grid is located on the right-hand side of
the screen. In the initial view it is set to _auto-hide_, but it will
expand as soon as you have opened or created a _Workflow_. It displays
all properties of the current selection within the _Workbench_.

If you click on an element, a description shows in the bottom of the pane.

If you enter text in the field _Filter_, the displayed properties are
successively reduced to those containing the entered text.
