= Credentials for OAuth

The Credentials for OAuth action step enables you to set up your OAuth credentials one time and then reference them in Email Action Steps that support OAuth Authentication. You can create a set of tokens that don't rely on a user password to authenticate with the email server and then use the token to repeatedly log in to the services without asking for the user's password again.

[[properties]]
== Properties

* *OAuth Authentication* Settings
** *OAuth Host*
+
The host address used to get the credentials. The default address for Outlook services is `+https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/+`. This address might change if the customer uses a self-hosted service.
** *Client ID*
+
To authenticate with the OAuth Host, an Azure application must be defined in the customer's space. This Azure application has an ID, that is unique in the entire OAuth Host space and it allows users to explicitly grant or revoke access for this Azure application to their accounts. For more information on how to create this Azure application for Outlook, visit https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app[Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform^].
** *Client Secret*
+
Allows RPA Builder to prove to the OAuth Host that it received permission to access user accounts on behalf of the registered Azure application. Without this permission, authentication is not possible.
** *Redirect Uri*
+
The URI to which the OAuth Host redirects after the user has completed the authentication attempt. This redirect URI must be registered with the Azure application. If the entered redirect URI matches one of the registered URIs, the OAuth Host allows the authentication.
** *Scopes*
+
Defines which permissions the user grants to the Azure application. By default, RPA Builder requests the following permissions:

*** *offline_access*
+
(*Required*) Enables access via a refresh token, which you can use to repeatedly log in to the email services without requiring user interaction each time.
*** *+https://outlook.office.com/IMAP.AccessAsUser.All+*
+
(*Required* when using IMAP) Enables reading and moving emails from the Outlook IMAP server.
*** *+https://outlook.office.com/POP.AccessAsUser.All+*
+
(*Required* when using POP3) Enables reading emails from the Outlook POP3 server.
*** *+https://outlook.office.com/SMTP.Send+*
+
(*Required* when using SMTP) Enables sending emails from the Outlook SMTP server.
*** *openid email*
+
Enables RPA Builder to automatically detect the email account used to log in to the Azure application. If this scope is omitted, you must provide an email in the wizard.
+
** *Save data to generate Tokens via the Tools menu*
+
Saves the current data for further use when <<generate-oauth-token, Generating an OAuth Refresh Token>>.
+
** *Email address*
+
The email address populates automatically if RPA Builder detects it from the authentication attempt. If the *openid email* scope is omitted, you must provide an email address manually.

Follow these steps to authenticate with your credentials:

. Complete the *OAuth Authentication* configuration by specifying the required properties.
+
Refer to <<properties, Properties>> for a description of each property.
. Click *Authenticate*.
+
This step starts the authentication process with the OAuth Host, which opens the login page in your default browser.
. In the OAuth Host’s login page, complete the login process.
. Close the browser.

After completing the last step, the wizard shows that you are authenticated:

=== Generating an OAuth Refresh Token

To generate and configure a refresh token:

. In the *Tools* menu, select *Generate OAuth Refresh Token*.
+

. Complete the *OAuth Token Creator* form that appears.

+
If you already configured the Credentials for OAuth Action Step details and clicked the *Save data to generate Tokens via the Tools menu* button, the data automatically populates with the last data you entered in the wizard.
. Click *Authenticate*.
. Click *Copy Token to Clipboard*.
. Paste the token in an alphanumeric Server Based Variable.
. Pin the variable to the field *Refresh Token* in the *Credentials for OAuth* wizard.
+
You can also pin the other values from the *OAuth Token Creator*.
+
By using a Server Based Variable you don’t need to upload a new version of your Workflow to RPA Manager if your token expires or your user gets logged out of Microsoft. In this case, regenerate the refresh token for the same user with the *OAuth Token Creator* and update the assigned Server Based Variable on RPA Manager.
