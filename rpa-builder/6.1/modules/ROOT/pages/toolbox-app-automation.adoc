App Automation lets you address elements directly through their XPaths.
The appearance and coordinates are not relevant, in contrast to the
Mouse Action and Pattern Search Action Steps. The advantage of this
approach is that App Automation works even if the position or design of
the target application changes on the desktop.

In addition, App Automation makes it easier to create workflows, by
recording clicks and keyboard inputs to generate Action Steps
automatically.

== Generating Action Steps

There are two ways to generate Action Steps automatically.

* {blank}
+
*RPA Manager*: During the Design phase on RPA Manager, you have the
option to record a process with a sequence of clicks and keyboard
inputs. You can download RPA Recorder
directly there (for more information, see xref:rpa-manager::index.adoc[RPA Manager Overview]).
Once you have finished the recording, you can upload it to RPA Manager,
together with the generated process, and move the process to the Build
phase. You can then download and open the process in RPA Builder.
All the recorded information for generating the Action Steps
automatically is now available.

* {blank}
+
*RPA Builder*: If the _App Session_ does not contain any elements
yet, you can use the wizard to start a local recording, which you can
then use to generate App Automation Action Steps automatically. After
you select _Start Capturing_ in the wizard of the App Session and
completed the recording, you can then click _OK & generate_. The Action
Steps are then generated automatically.


== Example

In this example, Microsoft Excel is called, a new Excel workbook is
opened, and text is inserted in the first row. In the following, you
will see the corresponding clicks and keyboard inputs, together with an
example of a filled wizard for a Click App Element Action Step.

You can now edit the generated workflow, for example, adding additional
Action Steps or renaming existing ones.

The red highlighting in the wizard preview immediately shows you where
the click was executed.

The following types of applications are supported:

== Common Properties (App Automation)
////
The _App Automation_ Action Steps also possess the _common properties_
of the other Action Steps, as described in the chapter
Common Properties.
////
The following are properties common to all _App Automation_ Action Steps:

*Identify Element*

The wizard contains the _Identify Element_ button in all Action Steps of
the App Automation. This button sets the wizard to _a Capture Mode,_
which lets you hover the mouse over a certain element and capture it by
pressing F2.

As soon as you hover the mouse over an element and press F2, the
following happens:

* {blank}
+

A frame is drawn around the element.

* {blank}
+

The Element XPath and Window Title are filled with the values of the
selected element.

* {blank}
+

The preview shows a screen shot with the selected element. The element
is marked with red crosshairs.

* {blank}
+

If the selected element does not match the Action Step, a warning is
displayed below the preview. This is the case, for example, if an
element that does not support text entry is selected in a _Set Text to
App Element_ Action Step. In this case, the frame is displayed in red
instead of green.


*Element _XPath_* XPath is short for “XML path language” and is used to
identify and address elements. The XPath is read using the
_Identify Element_, as described above, or can be entered manually. 

*Window Title* The name of the window to use.

*Use Regular Expression (Regex)* If this option is selected, the Window
Title is interpreted as a Regex expression.

*Preview* You see a preview of the selected element here. It only
appears if the element was selected using Identify Element or the if
Action Step was generated automatically.
