= Using Search Patterns in a Workflow 

The *Capture* functionality provided in the Search Pattern, Pattern Select, and Pattern Gallery Action Steps enables you to create search patterns from a screenshot. Then, you can use these patterns in different elements of your Workflow. The Search Pattern, Pattern Select, and Pattern Gallery Action Steps also share the Pattern Strip module in the wizard, which provides a list of the existing patterns and their associated operations.

== Adding a Pattern from Screen Capture

You can create search patterns in the Search Pattern, Pattern Select, and Pattern Gallery Action Steps by capturing a screenshot. The menu bars for these Action Steps include a *Capture* button (image:capture-button-icon.png[2%, 2%, The Capture button.]) for this purpose. 

Clicking *Capture* freezes the screen content like a screenshot and a small window with the title Capture Patterns appears. Then, you can select the search pattern by clicking and dragging to specify the area that contains the pattern. The selection surrounded with a blue rectangle is no longer transparent gray and you can move or resize it using the mouse or the keyboard. Press `Shift+Arrow key` to move the selection. Press `Ctrl+Arrow key` to resize the selection by moving the right and bottom edges.

Select more than one search pattern by clicking and dragging multiple times. If the selected image detail is too small, not adequately differentiated, or if it contains too few of the features needed to recognize a search pattern, the search pattern definition window shows a red cross with a red background.

image::incorrect-search-pattern.png[20%, 20%, The search pattern area shows a red cross, which indicates that the selection is not suitable as a search pattern.]

Click *Accept selection & continue* to add the applicable pattern to the wizard for the relevant Action Step. The wizard enables you to specify names and color spots for each of the captured patterns.

To cancel the recording of a search pattern at any time, click the close button (*X*) in the upper right corner of the Capture Patterns window. 

== The Capture Patterns Window 

image::capture-patterns-window.png[30%, 30%, The Capture Patterns window]

* *Unfreeze screen* 
+
Releases the frozen screen so that changes can be made on the screen again.
* *Define Search Area* 
+
Enables you to reduce the search area from full screen to a smaller area by clicking and dragging the mouse. The selection is transparent red with a red border. When defining the search area, you can unfreeze and refreeze the screen.
* *Reuse last defined Search Area* 
+
Enables you to reuse a search area defined in a previous capture. This option shows only if you already defined a search area when setting up the Workflow. 
* *Accept selection & continue* 
+
Adds the selection into the wizard for the corresponding Action Step and then returns to that Action Step.

After you capture at least one search pattern, the *Delete selected pattern* option shows. This option removes the border around the previously selected pattern (or the last search area defined).

=== Unfreeze Screen 

When you click *Unfreeze screen* the Capture Patterns window changes as follows:

image::take-a-screenshot-window.png[30%, 30%, The Take a screenshot window that shows after clicking Unfreeze Screen.]

* *Capture screen* 
+
Freezes the screen image again so that the pattern can be captured. 
* *Capture screen with delay* 
+
Starts the timer. After a delay, the screen image refreezes and the Capture Patterns window reappears.

[[using-color-spot-with-search-patterns]]
== Using Color Spot with Search Patterns

By default, RPA Builder only captures the pattern features for search patterns and color plays no role in pattern-based searches. However, sometimes you may find that it is necessary to determine when the color in a certain position in the search pattern is correct. For example, the text of an error message needs to be in red, or a traffic light symbol needs to appear green rather than yellow or red. In order to guarantee this, there is an option to define a Color Spot for a Search Pattern. In the case of a Search Pattern with Color Spot, the pattern-based image search is successful only if the color in a defined position matches a predefined color.

When you hover a search pattern in the wizard for the relevant Action Step, an overlay menu bar shows at the end of the image. 

image:search-pattern-icons.png[20%, 20%, A search pattern with the overlay menu that shows the available actions.]

Click the *Color Spot Picker* (image:color-picker-icon.png[2%, 2%, The Color Spot Picker button.]) to open a window where you can select the color spot to use with the search pattern.

image:color-spot-picker-window.png[60%, 60%, The Color Spot Picker window.]

As you move the mouse over the image, the *Live values* section updates showing the following information: 

* *Color*
+
The color value, expressed in RGB color values (`R:255`, `G:255`, `B:255`), for the current image coordinates. 
* *Coordinates*
+
The image coordinates based on the current position of the mouse, indicated in `x;y` coordinates being `0;0` the upper-left corner of the image.

To define the current selection as a Color Spot, either click the left mouse button or press `Insert` or `Space` on the keyboard. 

To delete the Color Spot, use the `Delete` or `Backspace` key.

When you select a Color Spot, it shows in the *Selected Color Spot* section on the left side of the window. 

image:color-spot-picker-window-selected-color.png[60%, 60%, The Color Spot Picker window showing a selected color.]

The following settings lessen the restrictions on Color Spots:

* *Compare Radius (in pixels)* 
+
Determines the radius around the specified position for the Color Spot in which the specified color must be found. There is a graphical representation of this radius next to the input field.
* *Color Fuzziness (in bits)* 
+
Determines the color deviation which is permitted for each RGB color channel. Use this option to specify how many low-order digits in the binary 8-digit color code can be ignored when comparing the color.

[[pattern-strip]]
== The Pattern Strip Module

Pattern Strip is a UI module that is used across all the wizards for the Search Pattern, Pattern Select, and Pattern Gallery Action Steps. The Pattern Strip consists of a list of Search Patterns, the associated options, and a menu bar. The menu bar buttons vary according to the Action Step and the quantity and selection status of the search patterns.

.Pattern Strip for the Pattern Gallery Action Step:
image:pattern-strip-pattern-gallery.png[75%, 75%, The Pattern Strip module for the Pattern Gallery Action Step.]

.Pattern Strip for the Pattern Select Action Step:
image:pattern-strip-pattern-select.png[75%, 75%, The Pattern Strip module for the Pattern Select Action Step.]

Use the mouse to click and select search patterns. A white check mark appears on a blue background in the top-right corner to highlight a selected item. Click again to undo the selection.

Buttons for functions relating only to the selected patterns appear on the menu bar only if at least one pattern is selected.

=== Menu Bar

The Pattern Strip menu bar has general buttons that show in all related Action Steps and buttons that are specific to the Search Pattern, Pattern Select, and Pattern Gallery Action Steps. The following table shows the button images, names, descriptions, and also in which of the related Action Steps they are available:

=== Filtering for Pattern Names and Zooming Search Pattern Images 

image::search-pattern-filter-and-zoom.png[30%, 30%, The Filter box and the Zoom In and Zoom out buttons.]

The Pattern Gallery includes filter options in the main menu bar. Search Pattern and Pattern Select Action Steps show filter options at the beginning of the *Search Patterns* section in a separate menu bar and apply to all Pattern Strips in the wizard equally.

Entering text into the *Filter...* field hides all patterns in the subsequent sections of the wizard with names that do not contain the specified text. Filtering is applied as you type each letter. The filter text may appear in any position within the pattern name, but must be contiguous to be considered a match. 

For example: Consider a Search Pattern Action Step that contains search patterns with the following names `House`, `House1`, `Mouse`, and `Mouse1`. 

* If you type `use` in the filter, all images show. 
* If you type `1`, only `House1` and `Mouse1` show.
* If you type `H`, only `House` and `House1` show.

The *Zoom Out* (image:zoom-out-icon.png[2%, 2%, The Zoom Out button.]) and *Zoom In* (image:zoom-in-icon.png[2%, 2%, The Zoom In button.]) buttons make all pattern images in the wizard either smaller or larger.

=== Search Pattern Options 

When you position the mouse over a pattern, the following buttons appear:

image::search-pattern-icons.png[20%, 20%, A search pattern with the overlay menu that shows the available actions.]

* The *Edit* (image:edit-icon.png[2%, 2%, The Edit button.]) button enables you to rename the search pattern. Alternatively, you can click the name of the search pattern to rename it. This action also changes the name in the Pattern Gallery and all other Action Steps that use this pattern.
* The *Recapture Pattern* (image:capture-button-icon.png[2%, 2%, The Recapture Pattern button.]) button enables you to replace the pattern with a new screenshot. Recapturing the pattern ensure that both the pattern name and its position in the list remain the same. 
* The *Color Spot Picker* (image:color-picker-icon.png[2%, 2%, The Color Spot Picker button.]) button opens a window where you can select the Color Spot within the pattern. See xref:adding-a-pattern-from-screen-capture.adoc#using-color-spot-with-search-patterns[Using Color Spot with Search Patterns] for additional details about the Color Spot functionality. 
* The *Delete Pattern* (image:delete-unused-button-icon.png[2%, 2%, The Delete Pattern button.]) button deletes the pattern. You can also delete a selected pattern using the  *Delete Selection* (image:delete-selection-button-icon.png[2%, 2%, The Delete Selection button.]) button from the menu bar.
