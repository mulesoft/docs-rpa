Use a _Web Session_ to open and close the browser window in which
all the _Web Automation_ elements contained therein interact.

The _web session ID_ enables you to reuse a session that has already started in a different web
session.

* *Hide Command Prompt*
+
Hides the web driver’s command prompt (default). Can be displayed again for diagnostic purposes.
* *Initial URL*
+
The URL that the web session launches when it starts. Default: `about: blank`.
* *Keep out mouse*
+
When selected, at the start of the _Web session_ the
mouse moves to the corner defined in the _Move mouse to_
property. This feature enables you to avoid triggering hover effects
on a website accidentally.
* *Move mouse to*
+
Defines where the mouse pointer moves to if
_Keep out mouse_ is enabled.
* *Repeat keep out mouse*
+
When selected, the mouse moves to the
corner defined in the _Move mouse to_ property before each step within
the _Web Session_. This feature enables you to avoid triggering hover
effects on a website accidentally.
* *Script Timeout [sec]*
+
Maximum waiting time in seconds before the
internal scripting of the web driver aborts. Do not change
this value unless MuleSoft Support advises you to do so.
* *Start maximized*
+
Decide wether the browser window starts maximized.
* *Webdriver Retries*
+
Number of retries to establish a successful web
driver connection.
* *Webdriver Timeout [sec]*
+
After the assigned time, the web session aborts a Webdriver command.

== Activity Workflow Overlapping Web Session

You can use web sessions across workflows within a business process. For example, you can open a web session in an initial workflow, perform a web login there, and then process this workflow in a different, independent workflow.

The web session ID lets you use the session globally within the
workflow. To pass the web session on to another workflow within a
business process, the web session ID must be defined as an activity
parameter (and not as a workflow-based variable).

To do this, proceed as follows:

. Create a web session ID in the activity parameter.
. Link the web session ID with the workflow.
+
You will find the web session ID in the _Activity Parameters_ Action Step, which you placed in the
Workflow Initialization Block beforehand.
. Link the web session ID in the corresponding web session.
. Optionally, ff you want the web session to be closed at a later point in the
workflow, use the _Close Web Session_ Action Step.

== Closing a Web Session

There are three different variants for closing a web session:

* The closing of the browser is already contained in the web session
+
In this case, the session is closed automatically when session execution
is complete. This only applies if the web session is *not* linked with a
web session ID.
* The browser is not closed until the end of the workflow
+
If the web session block is linked with a web session ID, the browser
remains open. This only applies if the web
session was linked using a workflow-based variable. If it is linked with
an activity parameter, in contrast, the web session remains active –
that is, the browser remains open – and can be used further
//(see the chapter _Cross-Activity Workflow Web Session_).
* The browsers is closed by using the _Close Web Session_ action step
+
The Action Step _Close Web Session_ gives you the additional option of
closing the session at a specific point in the Workflow.

== Wizard

The Web Session Wizard contains the *Reuse Web Session*, *General Settings*, and *Browser Specific Settings* sections.

=== Reuse Web Session 
image:toolbox-variable-web-automation-web-session-images/image1.png[50%, 50%, An image of the Reuse web session section of the wizard]

The *Reuse Web Session* section defines which web session to reuse. To reuse a web session, use the *web session ID* that you previously saved in the Workflow-based variables.

image:toolbox-variable-web-automation-web-session-images/image2.png[75%, 75%, An image showing the web session ID]

You can define a name and a description and then RPA Builder assigns a value automatically. Once you have created the web session ID, you can link it
with the session using the drop-down in the Web Session Wizard.

In the script Run Results, you see whether a new web session was created
or a web session ID was used, and in the latter case, which one.

If you use a web session ID that was created with the web session type
Firefox, for example, but is to be continued with a different web
session type, such as a Chrome session, RPA Builder shows a warning. You can change this response with the *Browser Mismatch*
option. There are two options for this scenario:

* *Warning* (default)
+
The Workflow Run is assigned a warning, but continues
running. In this case, the original web session browser is used
automatically.
* *Error*
+
The Workflow Run ends in an error.

Define the standard response of the browser and the execution in the *General Settings* section.

=== General Settings 

image:toolbox-variable-web-automation-web-session-general-settings.png[50%, 50%, The General Settings section of the Wizard]

* *Initial URL*
+
Specifies the initial URL of the web page you
want to call.
+
If another web session that was created with the same web session ID is
opened, the initial URL from that session is ignored.

* *Open Browser Wizard when done*
+
If this option is enabled, the Browser
Wizard opens when the Web Session Wizard is closed.

* *Keep out mouse, move it to*
+ 
Use this option to define where you want the mouse to move to. This prevents the mouse from covering certain buttons or texts.
+
image:toolbox-variable-web-automation-web-session-images/image4.png[50%, 50%, "An image showing the Keep out mouse, move it to: option"]
+
You can also define whether or not you want to execute this action after
every Action Step.

//tag::pageLoadStrategy[]
* *Page load strategy* 
+
Defines the system behavior when loading a page.
The following options are available: Default, Normal, Eager, and None.
