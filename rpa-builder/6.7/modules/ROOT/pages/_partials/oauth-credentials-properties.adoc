** *E-Mail Provider*
+
Select either *Outlook* or *Google*.
** *Auth Endpoint*
+
URL for the OAuth authentication endpoint. Defaults to the following values, depending on the selected provider: 
+
*** *Outlook*: `+https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize+`
*** *Google*: `+https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth+`
+
** *Token Endpoint*
+
URL for the OAuth Refresh Token process. Defaults to the following values, depending on the selected provider: 
+
*** *Outlook*: `+https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/token+`
*** *Google*: `+https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v4/token+`
+ 
** *Client ID*
+
Client ID of your mail application. 
+
To authenticate with the OAuth host, you must define an Azure or Gmail application in your space. This application has an ID, that is unique in the entire OAuth host space and it enables users to explicitly grant or revoke access for this application to their accounts. 
+
For more information on how to create an Azure application for Outlook, visit https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app[Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform^].
** *Client Secret*
+
Client Secret of your mail application. 
+
Allows RPA Builder to prove to the OAuth host that it received permission to access user accounts. Without this permission, authentication is not possible.
** *Redirect URI*
+
The URI that the OAuth host redirects to after the user completes the authentication attempt. This redirect URI must be registered with the Azure or Gmail application. If the entered redirect URI matches one of the registered URIs, the OAuth host allows the authentication.
** *Scopes*
+
Defines which permissions the user grants to the Azure or Gmail application. By default, RPA Builder requests the following permissions depending on the selected provider:

*** *Outlook*
+
**** *`offline_access`*
+
(Required) Enables access via a refresh token, which you can use to repeatedly log in to the email services without requiring user interaction each time.
**** *`+https://outlook.office.com/IMAP.AccessAsUser.All+`*
+
(Required when using IMAP) Enables reading and moving emails from the Outlook IMAP server.
**** *`+https://outlook.office.com/POP.AccessAsUser.All+`*
+
(Required when using POP3) Enables reading emails from the Outlook POP3 server.
**** *`+https://outlook.office.com/SMTP.Send+`*
+
(Required when using SMTP) Enables sending emails from the Outlook SMTP server.
**** *`openid email`*
+
Enables RPA Builder to automatically detect the email account used to log in to the Azure application. If this scope is omitted, you must provide an email in the wizard.
+
*** *Google*
+
**** *`+https://mail.google.com/+`*
+
Enables RPA Builder to read, compose, send, and permanently delete emails from your Gmail account.
+
** *Save data to generate Tokens via the Tools menu*
+
Saves the current data for further use when <<generate-oauth-token, generating an OAuth refresh token>>.
+
** *Email address*
+
The email address populates automatically if RPA Builder detects it from the authentication attempt. If the *openid email* scope is omitted, you must provide an email address manually.
