= Session Based Variables 

Use Session Based Variables to share variables accross all workflows that run inside the same session. 

You can define session variables of the following types: 

* Alphanumeric
* Integer 
* Floating-point
* Boolean
* Array
* User account
* Web Session ID.

Use the Set Variable and the Set Array Variable action steps to overwrite the initial variable values with new values at a later point in the Workflow.

You can include only one instance of Session Based Variables in a Workflow and it must be in the Workflow Initialization section.

== Properties 

See xref:common-properties.adoc[].

== Inbound Variables 

This action step has no inbound variables. 

== Outbound Variables 

All Session Based Variables are outbound variables. Variables are specified in the format _Workflow Based Variables.<variableName>_.

Session Based Variables show in Variable Mappings only for action steps that support that type of variable.

== Wizard 

To create new variables: 

. Click *Add new parameter*.
. Select the type of variable to create. 
. Specify the variable's name, description, and value. 
. Click *OK* 

To delete variables, click the *Delete Variable* (image:delete-icon.png[2%, 2%, The Delete Variable button]) button. 

== Sharing Session Based Variables Between Workflows

To share Session Based Variables, ensure you create the variables in each workflow using the same variable name and type. When a workflow updates a variable, any successive workflow that reads the same variable uses the updated value of said variable.
