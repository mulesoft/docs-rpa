This action step moves a file from one directory to another. If the
file to be moved if not available or the moved file is already located
in the destination folder, an error message will interrupt the
_Workflow_.

== Properties

*File Operation Settings:*

* *Create directory if it does not exist* If this option is enabled,
Move File creates either the specified relative directory or the
whole specified path, if this does not already exist.
* *Destination directory* Enter the path to the destination directory
where the file that is to be moved will be saved. You can specify an
absolute or relative path. If a relative path is used, then the path
relates to the _Base Path_ variable.
* *Directory path** Enter the
path to the directory where the file to be moved is located. You can
specify an absolute or relative path. If a relative path is used, then
the path relates to the _Base Path_ variable.
* *File Name* The name of the file to move. 
+
This field does not support placeholders. For further information, see xref:toolbox-file-operations.adoc#invalid-characters[Path / file name / invalid characters].
* *Overwrite existing file* This option enables you to overwrite an
existing file with the same name in the destination folder.

Other Properties that are the same in all action steps are described in
the section on *Common Properties*. For reasons of
clarity they are not shown here.

== Inbound Variables

*Directory path** Enter the
path to the directory where the file to be moved is located. You can
specify an absolute or relative path. If a relative path is used, then
the path relates to the _Base Path_ variable.

*File Name* Enter the name here
of the file that is to be moved.

== Outbound Variables

*Destination directory* The _Move File.Destination directory_ variable
provides the path to the destination directory.

*IsMoved* The _Move File.IsMoved_ variable indicates whether the file
was successfully moved or not (True/False).

*File name* The _Move File.File Name_ variable provides the name of the
file that has been moved.

*Directory path*Â The _Move File.Directory Path_ variable provides the
path to the source directory.

////
More information about the environment variables (Insert Environment
Variable) and script variables (Insert Script Variable) used below can
be found under *Settings*.
////

* *Directory path* Specify the path to the file that is to be moved. You
can create an absolute path or a path relative to the _Base Path_.
// using the image:media\image1.png[image,width=175,height=22] and
//image:media\image2.png[image,width=129,height=22] buttons.
The initial
value is %STWS_BASEPATH%. Select an existing path.
//using the image:media\image3.png[image,width=20,height=20] button.
You can also
insert variables from the _Workflow_ in order to construct the path. To
do so, click on the pin and select one of the available variables.
* *File name* Enter the name of the file that is to be moved. You can
also insert a variable from the Workflow as the _File Name_. To do so,
click on the pin and select one of the available variables.
* *Destination directory* Specify the destination path for the file that
is to be moved. You can create an absolute path or a path relative to
the _Base Path_.
// using the image:media\image1.png[image,width=175,height=22] and
//image:media\image2.png[image,width=129,height=22] buttons.
The initial
value is %STWS_BASEPATH%. Select an existing path.
// using the image:media\image3.png[image,width=20,height=20] button.
You can also
insert variables from the _Workflow_ in order to construct the path. To
do so, click on the pin and select one of the available variables.
* *Overwrite existing file* If this option has not been enabled, an
error message will interrupt the _Workflow_ if there is already a file
with the same name in the destination directory. If this option has been
enabled and the file already exists, the moved file will replace it and
no acknowledgment will be given.
