The _Set Variable_ action step assigns a new value to a variable. You
can either enter the new value directly or use an existing variable of
the same type, e.g. the input variable of another _action step_. The
variables must be of the same type in order to populate one variable
with the content of another variable, e.g. you can only populate a
variable of type:Text with another variable of type:Text In order to
ensure that the types are the same, this _action step_ has to be
configured in several stages (see step-by-step instructions for the
wizard below). Validation of variable types is performed when the
_action step_ is launched.
// but you can also perform validation using the image:media\image1.png[image,width=21,height=25] button in the toolbar.

Variables from the _BasePath_ *cannot* be
modified using the _Set Variable_ action step. Attempting to do so will
generate an error message.

Changes to a variable are logged in the _Workflow Run Results_. The logs record both the old
and new values of the variables. Variable values that are longer than 16
characters are shown in truncated form.

== Properties

*Common*

* *New value* Enter the new value for the variable to be modified. This
field is only displayed when the new value is being entered manually. If
the new value is based on another variable, the field is not displayed.

Other properties that are the same in all action steps are described in
section 2.2. For reasons of clarity they are not shown here.

== Wizard

* *Variable* The field displays the variable that will be overwritten
with _Value_ as well as the variable's type. If "No Variable is mapped…"
is displayed, this means that no variable has been set using the
_Mappings Editor_ (in this case, proceed as described in the
step-by-step instructions below).
* *New value* Enter the new value for the variable to be modified. You
can also insert variables from the workflow.
//To do so, click the image:media\image2.png[image,width=17,height=24] button and select one of the available variables.

== Step-By-Step – Configure Set Variable as Follows

[arabic]
. Drag the _Set Variable_ action step to the desired position in the
workflow.
. Open the _Set Variable_ wizard.
. Enter a new value for the variable to be changed in the _Value_ field.
You can also insert variables from the _Workflow_. To do so, click the
pin button and select one of the available variables.
. Click on the pin in the _Set Variable_ action step in the _Workflow_.
. In the "Edit Variable Mappings for …" dialog, select the variable that
you wish to modify from the "Variable" drop-down menu. The drop-down
menu will only show variables that are of the same type. +
Use the "New value" drop-down menu to set the new variable to the value
of another variable. This menu also only displays variables that are of
the same type. To use the value specified in the wizard, leave the
<None> option in the drop-down menu. +
Confirm your selection with OK.
. The pin for the _Set Variable_ action step will now be shown in red.
. As an extra check, open the _Set Variable_ wizard. The "Variable"
field should now now show the variable to be changed, followed by its
type in brackets.
