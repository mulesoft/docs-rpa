= File Check

Use the _File Check_ Action Step to check whether a file exists
or not. You can evaluate the result using the _File Check.Check Succeeded_ variable and use it in the later stages of the workflow.

Before the process starts, the specified _Directory Path_
is checked against the _Allowed Paths_. If the _Directory Path_
specified in the Action Step is not allowed, the workflow is cancelled
and an error message displayed.

== Properties

* *File Operation Settings*

** *Directory path* Path to
the directory in which you want to search for the file. You can enter
the path either as an absolute or relative path. If you enter it as a
relative path, the path refers to the _Base Path_ variable.
** *File Check mode* Specify wether to check if the exists or if it doesn't exist. 
*** *File exists* (default) Checks whether the file exists. If it doesn't exist, the workflow stops and displays an error message.
*** *File not exists* Checks if the file _doesn't_ exist. If it does, the workflow stops and displays an error message.
** *File Name* Name of the file you are searching for.

This action step does not support using Placeholders. For additional details about path and file name settings and a list of unsupported characters, see xref:toolbox-file-operations.adoc#invalid-characters[Path / file name / invalid characters].


== Inbound Variables

* *Directory Path* The path used in the search.

== Wizard

//You can use the link:#AS_FileCheck_P_DirectoryPath[Directory path] to
Define the path to the file to be found. You can create an absolute path
or a path relative to the _Base Path_.
//using the image:media\image1.png[image,width=175,height=22] and
//image:media\image2.png[image,width=130,height=22] buttons.
The initial
value is `%STWS_BASEPATH%``. Select an existing path
//using the
//image:media\image3.png[image,width=20,height=20] button.
You can also
insert variables from the workflow to create the path. To do this, click
the pin and select one of the available variables.

////
You will find further information on environment variables (Insert
Environment Variable) and script variables (Insert Script Variable) in
the *Settings* chapter.
////

In the *File name* field, enter the name of
the file to be found. You can also insert the _File Name_ using a
variable from the workflow. To do this, click the pin and select one of
the available variables. You then use the *Check mode* to define the result that
is to be searched for.
