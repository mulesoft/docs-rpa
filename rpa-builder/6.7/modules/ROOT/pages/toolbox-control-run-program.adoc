

= Run Program

This action step is used to run a program by directly calling its
executable file.

== Properties

*Domain* If a process is started with a specific user, this defines the
domain of the user

*Inherit Environment* If process is started with a specific user, this
determines if the environment will be inherited from that user

*Interactive logon with profile* If this option is checked additionally
to the option _UseCredentials,_ the user’s profile from the registry is
passed on to the process.

*Password* If a process is started with a specific user, this is the
user's password. Only applicable if "Use Credentials" is set.

*Use Credentials* Determines whether to start the process with a
different user or not

**Username** If a process is
started with a specific user this is the user's name. Only applicable if
_Use Credentials_ is set.

*File name* Contains the full path to the executable file that should be
run

**Parameters** Defines
additional command line parameters to use when running the program

*Path is relative to 3rd Party Folder* The related process will be
started relative to the _3rd Party Folder_. This folder must be below
the scripts directory and can contain user-defined applications.

*Start mode* Sets the status of the application window (_Normal_,
_Maximized_, _Minimized_)

**Working Directory**
Defines the working directory of the process started

*Timeout* If _Wait for window_ _to appear_ is set, this defines how long
the action step will wait for the window to appear

*Use regular expression* If _Wait for window to appear_ is set, this
setting defines whether the _Window Title_ field contains a regular
expression or not

*Wait for window to appear* Defines whether the action step should
wait until the window appears

*Window Title* If _Wait for window_ _to appear_ is set, this defines the
_Window Title_ to wait for

== Inbound Variables

*File name*

*Working Dir*

*Parameters*

*Window TitleUsername*

*Password*

*Domain* Process Window Handle The window handle associated with
the newly opened window. (Only available if _Wait for window_ _to
appear_ is set.)

== Outbound Variables

*Process ID* The ID of the process that has been started

*Executable* The name of the executed file

*Working Dir* The working directory of the process

== Wizard

*Insert* Environment *Variable* Select and use any defined environment
variable as a path to the desired program file via the drop-down menu

*Auto-Replace Variables* If you have entered the path to the executable
manually or used the browse button to specify it, you can click this
button to check if there are any environment variables that can replace
parts of the path

You can place an executable file in the *_3rd Party Folder_* within the
folder where the project is saved. To do so, use the _Select & Copy File
to 3rd Party Folder…_ function in the drop-down menu accessed by
clicking the triangle symbol next to the browse button (...).

This is very useful if, for example, you want to use a user-defined
batch file in the _Workflow_. Using this function ensures that the
executable file can still be found correctly, even when the project
folder has been moved or deployed.

Select _Open 3rd Party Folder_ to copy files into the folder yourself.
If you use this option, remember to manually select the _Path is
relative to 3rd Party Folder_ checkbox and enter the filename to call
too. Using _Select & Copy…_ fills out the _File name_ field and selects
the checkbox automatically.

To select the program to run, enter the full path manually into the
_File name_ field or just browse to the executable file you want to run.
//by clicking *_…_*.

[TIP]
If you intend to use an _Image search_ within the application when it is running, it is recommended that you use _Maximized_ _Start mode_ so the application window will always be in the same position! This makes defining a reliable _Search area_ for the _Image search_ much easier.

As mentioned above, you can use _Windows_ environment
variables in the _File name_ and _Parameters_ field. This can be done
with both default environment variables defined by _Windows_
and with user-defined environment variables.

These environment variables contain paths to certain folders. For
example, _Internet Explorer_ is often installed in
_C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\_ or
_C:\Program Files x86\Internet Explorer\_. However, the folder might
have a completely different name, depending on the language used with
your operating system, or it might even be installed on a different hard
drive. To help avoid problems, the environment variable _%ProgramFiles%_
is set automatically to the correct folder when _Windows_ is
installed.
////
So, if you put the following entry in the _File Name_ field
of the _Run Program_ wizard, the executable file will be found on every
_Windows_ system:

image::toolbox-control-run-program-image1.png[Entry file name field]
////

Here is a list of the most important environment variables:

* *%ALLUSERSPROFILE%* The _All Users_ profile folder
* *%APPDATA%* The current user's application data folder (_Windows
Vista_ and later only)
* *%COMPUTERNAME%* The system name
* *%ProgramFiles%* is replaced by the current program path.

This variable depends on whether you are running a
32-bit or a 64-bit program. If you are running a 32-bit program,
_C:\Program Files (x86)_ is the resulting variable. If you are running a
64-bit program, _C:\Program Files_ is the resulting variable.

RPA Builder is usually run as a 64-bit program but the generated
workflow code, on the other hand, is usually run as a 32-bit program.
That is why the _Test Button_ in the wizard can provide you with a
different result than the actual run does later on.

To avoid possible differences when the programs are being run, it is
therefore recommended to use:

- the variable *%ProgramFiles(86)%* for 32-bit programs

- the variable *%ProgramW6432* for 64-bit programs. (This does not apply
to 32-bit-only Windows installations.)

* *%SystemRoot%* The system root folder
* *%SystemDrive%* The system drive letter
* *%USERPROFILE%* The current user's profile folder

You will find a complete list of predefined environment variables by
opening the drop-down menu _Insert Environment Variable_ in the _Run
program_ wizard.

If you want to test the new _Run program_ configuration, click the Test
button and the executable will be run according to the configuration.
