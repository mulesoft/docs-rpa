Using the _Group_ block gives you a clearer overview when designing your
Workflows. It provides delineation both graphically and in terms of
content within a Workflow. For example, you can easily use it to group
action step variables.

You can, however, also use all other action steps. A couple of
exceptions are the _Transaction_ action step and the _Workflow
Initialization_ element. It is possible to position multiple _Group_
blocks inside each other.

The _Group_ block does *not* restrict the availability of variables in
subsequent transactions such as the _Transaction_ action step, for example.

== Properties

The _Group_ block has no properties.

== Inbound Variables

The _Group_ block possesses no inbound variables.

== Outbound Variables

The _Group_ block possesses no outbound variables.
