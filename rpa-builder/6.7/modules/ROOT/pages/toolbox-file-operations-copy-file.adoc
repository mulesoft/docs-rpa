= Copy File

This action step copies a file from one directory to another. If the
file to be copied if not available or the copied file is already located
in the destination folder, an error message will interrupt the
_Workflow_.

== Properties

*File Operation Settings:*

* *Create directory if it does not exist* If this option is enabled,
Copy File creates either the specified relative directory or the
whole specified path, if this does not already exist.
* *Destination directory* Enter the path to the target directory where the copied file
is to be saved here. You can specify an absolute or relative path. If a
relative path is used, then the path relates to the _Base Path_
variable.
* *Directory path* This is
where you enter the path to the directory where the file to be copied
from. You can specify an absolute or relative path. If a relative path
is used, then the path relates to the _Base Path_ variable.
* *File Name* The name of the file to copy.
+
This field does not support placeholders. For further information, see xref:toolbox-file-operations.adoc#invalid-characters[Path / file name / invalid characters].
* *New File Name* Enter a new name for the file that is to be inserted.
This option will only be reported if the option *Use different file
name* has been selected.
* *Overwrite existing file* This option enables you to overwrite an
existing file with the same name in the destination folder.
* *Use different file name* Selecting this option means that the copied
file will be saved under a new name in the destination directory. Enter
the new name in the *New File Name* field.

// Other Properties that are the same in all action steps are described in

More information about the environment variables (Insert Environment
Variable) and script variables (Insert Script Variable) used below can
be found under *Settings*.
////

//using the image:media\image1.png[image,width=175,height=22] and image:media\image2.png[image,width=129,height=22] buttons.
The initial value is %STWS_BASEPATH%.
//Select an existing path using the image:media\image3.png[image,width=20,height=20] button.
You can also insert variables from the _Workflow_ in order to construct the path. To
do so, click on the pin and select one of the available variables.
* *File name* Enter the name of the file that is to be copied here. You
can also insert a variable from the Workflow as the _File Name_. To do
so, click on the pin and select one of the available variables.
* *Destination directory* Specify the destination path for the file that
is to be copied. You can create an absolute path or a path relative to
the _Base Path_.
//using the image:media\image1.png[image,width=175,height=22] and image:media\image2.png[image,width=129,height=22] buttons.
The initial value is %STWS_BASEPATH%.
//Select an existing path using the image:media\image3.png[image,width=20,height=20] button.
You can also insert variables from the _Workflow_ in order to construct the path. To
do so, click on the pin and select one of the available variables.
* *New file name* This field will only be shown if you have enabled the
option *Use different file name for copy*. The wizard uses the file name
of the source file and adds _copy at the end. You can also specify the
new name for the copied file yourself. You can also insert a variable
from the Workflow as the _New file name_. To do so, click on the pin and
select one of the available variables.
* *Overwrite existing file* If this option has not been enabled, an
error message will interrupt the _Workflow_ if there is already a file
with the same name in the destination directory. If this option has been
enabled and the file already exists, the copied file will replace it and
no acknowledgment will be given.
