The _Stopwatch_ is basically a combined _Start/Stop Timer_ with a clear
graphical representation. It also enables you to use additional timer
modes in combination with the _Loop_ item.

== Properties

*Timer mode* Decide how the measured time will be computed when the
_Stopwatch_ is within a _Loop_. See below for details.

== Inbound Variables

*Suffix* can be used if the _Stopwatch_ is within the _Control Block_'s
_File Controlled Loop_. A suffix is then added to the name of the
_Stopwatch_ during every loop. Each suffix is a column entry in the file
that was imported in the _File Controlled Loop_.

== Outbound Variables

The action step _Stopwatch_ has no outbound variables.

== Wizard

The _Stopwatch_ wizard is similar to the _Transaction_ wizard. It
suggests the name of the surrounding _Transaction_ to be _Stopwatch_ by
default. Just edit the name to change it if required.

== Timer Modes (Using the Stopwatch within a Loop)
////
image:media\image1.png[image,width=303,height=128]The example to the
left launches an application, checks if it is loaded via _Image search_,
and then kills the application again. It will repeat this five times and
each run will be measured by the _Stopwatch_.
////
Use the _Timer mode_ setting for the _Stopwatch_ to determine how the measurement value is
calculated:

* *Last* The last measured time is saved
* *Average* The Workflow calculates an average value of all measured times
and saves it
* *Min* The fastest measured time is saved
* *Max* The slowest measured time is saved
