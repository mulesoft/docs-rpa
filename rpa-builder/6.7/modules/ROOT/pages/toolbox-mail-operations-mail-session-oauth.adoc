= Mail Session (OAuth)

The _Mail Session (OAuth)_ Action Step is an inclusive element for email operations that enables you to establish a connection to an email server using MS Outlook or Gmail and then perform email operations such as *Read Mail*, *Send Mail*, and *Set Mail* (to change email) by using the corresponding Action Steps.

== Before you Begin

You must have an Azure account to create an application for Outlook.

== Wizard

image:mail-session-outlook-oauth-wizard.png[The Mail Session (Outlook with OAuth) Action Step Wizard, 60%, 60%]

The wizard contains the following sections:

* *Operation Mode*
* *OAuth Authentication*
* *Incoming Mail*
* *Outgoing Mail*

=== Operation Mode

In *Operation Mode* you determine what happens and which area activates in the Mail Session. The
following modes are available:

* *Read and send mails*
+
Enables you to configure the Incoming and Outgoing
Mail areas so that you can read and send emails.
* *Read mails from inbox*
+
Enables editing for the Incoming Mail section so that you can only read emails.
+
If you select the _Read mails from inbox_ mode, you can't use the Send Mail Action Step.
* *Send mails via SMTP*
+
Enables editing for the Outgoing Mail section so that you can only send emails.
+
If you select the _Send mails via SMTP_ mode, you can't use the Read Mail Action Step in the Mail Session.

=== OAuth Authentication

The *OAuth Authentication* section enables you to create a set of tokens that don't rely on a user password to authenticate with the email server. After you create the refresh token, you can use it to repeatedly log in to the services without asking for the user's password again.

Follow these steps to authenticate with your credentials:

. Complete the *OAuth Authentication* configuration by specifying the required properties.
+
Refer to <<properties, OAuth Authentication Settings>> for a description of each property.
. Click *Authenticate*.
+
This step starts the authentication process with the OAuth Host, which opens the login page in your default browser. 
+
To enable using different accounts to log in, Mail Session (Outlook with OAuth) clears credentials stored in browser cookies when you click *Authenticate*. 
. In the OAuth Hostâ€™s login page, complete the login process.
. Close the browser.

After completing the last step, the wizard shows that you are authenticated:

== Generating an OAuth Refresh Token

Instead of authenticating via the *Mail Session (Outlook with OAuth) wizard*, you can pin the refresh token if you obtain it externally. In this case, you still need to populate or pin the remaining fields.

include::partial$generate-oauth-token-steps.adoc[]

=== Incoming Mail

In the *Incoming Mail* area, you can configure all the settings necessary to import emails from an email server. You can use the *Test Connection Button* to test whether the connection to the email server can be established.

=== Outgoing Mail

The *Outgoing Mail* area opens if you select the *Send mails* checkbox. To send emails, enter the SMTP email server settings here.

Use the *Send test mail* button to check the connection to the SMTP server and send a test email to the email address specified in the *Sendtest mail to* field.
