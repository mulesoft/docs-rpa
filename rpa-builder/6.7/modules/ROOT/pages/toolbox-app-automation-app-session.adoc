= App Session

The _App Session_ action step is, similar to the Excel Session, an
inclusive element for all App Automation action steps. These steps can
only be placed within the App Session. All other action steps can also
be inserted in the App Session.

Please note that an App Session *cannot* be added to another App
Session.
