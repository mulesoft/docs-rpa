The _Select Case_ action step makes it possible to match the contents of
a variable against certain predefined cases. For example, you can search
the content of a text variable for specific information and specify
different action steps to be executed depending on what is found. The
“DoElse” component is always present. This is used to provide a default
action for cases that have not been specified.

== Properties

*Misc*

* *CaseValue* Enter the comparison value for the selected case query.
This is the value that will be compared with a variable or that will be
searched for.
* *Text Affinity* Value for the textual similarity in a fuzzy search,
expressed as a percentage. A value of 0% denotes no similarity while a
value of 100% means identical. The default value is 50%.
* *CompareValue String*
* *Compare Value Int* Integer
* *Compare Value Bool*
* *Compare Value Float*

Other properties that are the same in all action steps are described in
section *Common Properties*. For reasons of
clarity they are not shown here.

== Wizard

* *Type* One of the following variable types:
** *Integer* Positive or negative integer
** *Alphanumeric* Characters that are either letters or numeric digits,
or both (text)
** *Boolean* Boolean value (True/False)
** *Float* Positive or negative floating-point number

If you have already defined cases and then change the type, a warning
will be shown informing you that all the cases in _Select Case_ will be
lost. This is because cases in a _Select Case_ are generated based on
the previously selected data type and it is not possible to simply
convert the type of existing cases without further consideration.

* *Cases* You can create one or more cases
//using the image:media\image2.png[image,width=105,height=29] button
depending on which data type you have selected above. After you have created a case, you can
//use the image:media\image3.png[image,width=40,height=24] button to
modify it.
//Use the image:media\image4.png[image,width=32,height=30] button to delete a case that was created unintentionally.

A step-by-step guide to configuring _Select Case_ is provided below.

Step-by-step – Configure _Select Case_ as follows (text variable as an
example):

[arabic]
. Drag _Select Case_ to the desired place in the Workflow.
. Open the _Select Case_ wizard.
. In the drop-down *Type* menu, choose the data type of the variable
that is to be checked. This example uses a text variable, so select the
type *Alphanumeric*. A detailed description of the properties and
configuration options for the various data types is provided in the
section on *Data types and comparison options* below.

Type conversion takes place in the following order of precedence: +
Boolean -> Integer -> Float -> String +
This means that if the variable being checked is of type Boolean, you
can use variables of the types Boolean, Integer, Float or String when
evaluating the case. If the variable being checked is of type Float, you
can only use variables of the types Float or String to evaluate the
case. If you are not sure what data type the variable being checked is,
then is best to use the type String for case evaluation!

[arabic, start=4]
. Create a case using the
image:media\image2.png[image,width=105,height=29] button.
. image:media\image5.png[image,width=299,height=102]Edit the Case using
the image:media\image3.png[image,width=40,height=24] button. The
following dialog is displayed.
. Enter the text for this case in the “Value” field in the “Edit Value
Window” dialog. Next you will set up a search that will find part of
this text.
. In the drop-down “String Compare Mode“ menu select the item
“Substring”.
. Click OK to close the “Edit Value Window” dialog box.
. You can now create additional cases and also delete cases that have
been created unintentionally using the
image:media\image4.png[image,width=32,height=30] button.
. Click OK to close the _Select Case Wizard_.
. Click on the pin for the _Select Case_ action step in the Workflow
(see figure): +
image:media\image6.png[image,width=341,height=35]
. In the “Edit Variable Mappings for Select Case” dialog box, select one
of the available variables in the corresponding drop-down menu. In this
example, that would be a variable from the drop-down “Compare Value
String” menu. Confirm your selection with OK.
. The pin for the _Select Case_ action step will now be shown in red.
. Drag at least one action step to be performed into the newly created
Case in _Select Case_. This action step will now be performed if the
condition specified for the case is met (steps 5 to 7 above).

== Data Types and Comparison Options

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|*File type* |*Comparison options*
|Integer (positive or negative whole number) a|
= variable must match exactly

≠ variable must not be a match

< variable must be less than Value

+>+ variable must be greater than Value

≤ variable must be less than or equal to Value

≥ variable must be greater than or equal to Value

|Alphanumeric (text) a|
*Full match*: Value found must match exactly

*Substring*: Part of the text in Value must match

*Regex comparison*: Search for matches for the regular expression entered
as the Value. More information about _Regular Expressions_ is provided
in the section on *Using Regular Expressions*.

*Fuzzy*: Search for text similar to that in Value Adjust the level of
similarity, expressed as a percentage, using the slider under “Text
Affinity”. The default value is 50%. A higher value means that fewer
matches will be found.

|Boolean (True or False) a|
For Boolean there is only one case because this is sufficient in
combination with “DoElse” to cover the two possibilities of True and
False.

*False*: Value in evaluated variable must be False.

*True*: Value in evaluate variable must be True.

|Float (positive or negative floating-point number) a|
= variable must match exactly

≠ variable must not be a match

< variable must be less than Value

+>+ variable must be greater than Value

≤ variable must be less than or equal to Value

≥ variable must be greater than or equal to Value
