_Delete File_ will delete a file located at the specified path. The
action step can be used, for example, to delete files which were
generated within a _Workflow_. If the file for deletion does not exist,
the action step does *not* terminate the Workflow with an error. There
is however an option that enables the generation of an error message in
the event of a non-existent file.

== Properties

*File Operation Settings*

* *Directory path* Enter the path to the directory from which the file
is to be deleted. You can specify an absolute or relative path. If a
relative path is used, then the path relates to the _Base Path_
variable.
* *File Name* The name of the file to delete.
+
This field does not support placeholders. For further information, see xref:toolbox-file-operations.adoc#invalid-characters[Path / file name / invalid characters].

* *Force error if file does not exist* If this option has been enabled,
an error message will interrupt the _Workflow_ if the file for deletion
does not exist. If this option is not enabled and the file does not
exist, the _Workflow_ will continue and no error message will be
generated.

Other Properties that are the same in all action steps are described in
the section on *Common Properties*. For reasons of
clarity they are not shown here.

== Inbound Variables

* *Directory path* Enter the path to the directory from which the file
is to be deleted. You can specify an absolute or relative path. If a
relative path is used, then the path relates to the _Base Path_
variable.

* *File Name* Enter the name of the file that is to be deleted.

== Outbound Variables

*IsDeleted* The _Delete File.IsDeleted_ variable indicates whether the
file could be deleted or not (True/False).

*File Name* The _Delete File.File Name_ variable provides the name of
the file that is to be deleted.

*Directory path*Â The _Delete File.Directory Path_ variable provides the
path that is used.

== Wizard

* *Directory path* Specify the path to the file that is to be deleted.
You can create an absolute path or a path relative to the _Base Path_.
//using the image:media\image1.png[image,width=175,height=22] and image:media\image2.png[image,width=129,height=22] buttons.
The initial value is %STWS_BASEPATH%. Select an existing path.
//using the image:media\image3.png[image,width=20,height=20] button.
You can also insert variables from the _Workflow_ in order to construct the path. To
do so, click on the pin and select one of the available variables.

More information about the environment variables (Insert Environment
Variable) and script variables (Insert Script Variable) can be found in
the section *Settings*.

also insert a variable from the Workflow as the _File Name_. To do so,
click on the pin and select one of the available variables.
* *Force error if file does not exist* If this option has been enabled,
an error message will interrupt the _Workflow_ if the file for deletion
does not exist. If this option is not enabled and the file does not
exist, the _Workflow_ will continue and no error message will be
generated.
