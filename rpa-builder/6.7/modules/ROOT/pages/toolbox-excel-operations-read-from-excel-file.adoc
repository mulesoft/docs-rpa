Use the _Read from Excel File_ action step to read the contents of an
Excel file. The result will be saved as a string or an array, which you
can then use as an Outbound Variable in subsequent action steps.

The _Read from Excel File_ action step can only be used inside an Excel
Session. Specify the source file in the xref:toolbox-excel-operations-excel-session.adoc[Excel
Session].

*Read from Excel File.ResultAsArray* This variable will be output as an
array if you have selected Column or Row as the mode.

populated, the result is _True_.

== Wizard

The *Sheet name* field is for
selecting the spreadsheet from which text should be read. You can type
directly into the input field, select an existing sheet from the
drop-down list or connect with a Pin Variable. The drop-down lists
contains all the sheets saved within the Excel file.

In *Excel Mode* you specify via the drop-down list whether to read a
cell, a row or an entire column. You can enter letters or numbers as a
value or connect with a Pin Variable.
