This action step can reset an error state to OK. A process can thus be
continued despite an ERROR. In addition to this, it does not have any
other configurable settings or wizard functions.

Please note that the action step is only useful if you set it in the
_OnError_ section of a Managed Block. This is because only in this
section will the error be treated as dealt with and processing the
Activity Workflow can be continued.

If you place the action step at a different point and the error occurs
with a prior action step, the _Force OK State_ action step can never be
called. The Activity Workflow will therefore be terminated with Error at
this point.
