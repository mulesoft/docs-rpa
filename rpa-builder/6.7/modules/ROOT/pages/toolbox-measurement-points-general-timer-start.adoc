_General timers_ are used to measure whole _Transactions_.

First place the _Start Timer_ and then the _Stop Timer_ by the
_Transaction_ elements for which the run time is to be measured.

_General timers_ are *not* valid as _Measurement Points_ and cannot
therefore be linked to a _Data Source_.
