With the _Set Mail_ action step, you can change the status of an e-mail.
That is, you can mark it either as read or unread and/or move it to a
different folder.

You can only use the Set Mail action step within the Read Mail Action
Step. You enter the information required for the connection to the mail
server in the Mail Session.
