The _Regex Tester_ is a tool in RPA Builder that enables you to create and test regular expressions.
You can open the _Regex Tester_ in three different ways:

* In the top menu bar, click *Tools* -> *Open Regex Tester*.
* In the top menu bar, click the *Open Regex Tester* button (image:advanced-concepts-using-regular-expressions-testing-regular-expression-image1.png[Regex Tester icon, 2%, 2%]).
* In an action step that supports Regex, click the *Test Regex* button (image:test-regex-icon.png[Regex Tester icon, 2%, 2%]).
+
Opening the _Regex Tester_ this way automatically transfers any regular expressions and text patterns associated with the action step to the tool.
