= Credentials for OAuth

The Credentials for OAuth action step enables you to set up your OAuth credentials one time and then reference them in Action Steps that support OAuth Authentication. You can create a set of tokens that don't rely on a user password to authenticate with the email server and then use the token to repeatedly log in to the services without asking for the user's password again.
