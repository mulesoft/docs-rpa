= Stopwatch Collection

The Stopwatch Collection Action Step enables you to collect all timer values from the _Stopwatch_ and the _General Timer_ Actions Steps configured in an Activity Workflow. 

Because all Stopwatch values are determined at the end of the workflow, you can only place this Action Step in the Workflow Finalization section.
