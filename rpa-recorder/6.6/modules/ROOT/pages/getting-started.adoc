== Considerations for Process Recording

Consider the following scenarios when recording processes with RPA Recorder to ensure the captured events are as accurate and robust as possible. 

* *Recording applications started as an administrator*
** To capture a process where you need to run an application as an administrator, you must run RPA Recorder as an administrator. Otherwise, RPA Recorder cannot capture the events from the application.
** Because you cannot start RPA Recorder as an administrator from RPA Manager, this process works only when you start RPA Recorder in standalone mode by right-clicking the executable file or the shortcut and selecting *Run as Administrator*. 

* *Record processes using a single screen*
** If your setup uses multiple monitors, use only the screen where RPA Recorder shows the *Recording Toolbar* to capture the entire process. 
** To prevent issues during the recording, avoid opening applications on a different screen or moving windows between screens. 

* *Do not change system settings during a recording*
** To prevent inaccuracies in the captured events, do not change any system settings (specially display settings such as screen resolution or scaling) while recording a process.
