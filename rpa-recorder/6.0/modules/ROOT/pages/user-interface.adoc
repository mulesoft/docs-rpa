// New recording session is started via this button, or alternatively by the hotkey F8.
// When the recording has been started the main view gets collapsed into a minified view.

// Manual screenshots can be taken via this button, or alternatively by the hotkey F9. This opens the [Define screenshot](xref:) dialog, in which the user has the option between full-screen or partial area screenshot.
//
// Variables can be entered via this button, or alternatively by the hotkey F10. This opens the [Add variable](xref:) dialog.
//
// Comments can be entered via this button, or alternatively by the hotkey F11. This opens the [Add Comment](xref:) dialog, where user can enter a comment.

// You can add new activities directly to the recorded BPMN by clicking the *Add Activity* button image:add-activity-icon.png[Add new activities], or by pressing `F12`. This opens the <<Add Activity>> dialog.
//
// Activities can be RPA Bot Tasks, which represent Workflows done by RPA Bots, User Tasks or External Tasks.

// During recording, each mouse click is automatically recorded with coordinates and type (left click, right click, etc.). If you want to record a mouse over hover action, hold the mouse pointer over the corresponding position and press the hotkey F2.
// This records the coordinates and a mouse over hover action for this position.

== Toast Notifications While Recording

When a recording state changes, a toast notification appears indicating current state. The notification stays for 2 seconds and disappears automatically.

== Define Screenshot

Before you take a screenshot manually, the screen automatically freezes. You can select a method for taking manual screenshots:

[NOTE]
Pause the recording before adding a comment. If you open the Add Comment Window while the recording is running, it pauses automatically.

Possible activity types are:

* Web Task
* Bot Task
* User Task

When you create a Web Task, you can choose to continue using the session of the last closed Web Task.

For User Tasks, RPA Recorder does not save documentation. You need to enter a description instead.

To continue recording, add a Bot Task.

[NOTE]
Pause the recording before adding an activity or changing the creation mode of the activities. If you open the pop-up using the respective hotkey, while the recording is running, the recording automatically pauses.
