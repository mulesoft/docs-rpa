= RPA Recorder Overview

RPA Recorder is MuleSoftâ€™s tool for recording a business process.

RPA Recorder enables you to:

* Record actions like mouse clicks, keyboard inputs and used applications.
* Add comments and variable information during the recording.
* Take screenshots automatically per mouse click, or manually at any time.

You can start RPA Recorder either directly from RPA Manager in the design phase, or as a standalone tool without server connection.

* If started from RPA Manager, RPA Recorder automatically uploads the recorded BPMN process model with the documentation into the server, and creates a local PDF with the same information after the recording is finished.
* If used without server connection, RPA Recorder creates the BPMN and stores it locally.

In either case, RPA Recorder also creates a XES file for further processing in process mining tools.
