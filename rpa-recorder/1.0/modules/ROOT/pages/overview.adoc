= RPA Recorder Overview

The X1 Process Recorder is used to record a business process.

All actions like mouse clicks, keyboard inputs and used applications will be recorded. Additionally, comments and variable information can be added during the recording.
Screenshots are taken automatically per mouse click, but screenshots can also be taken manually at any time.

The X1 Process Recorder can be started directly from the X1 Server in the design phase. The recorded BPMN process model is then uploaded with the documentation after the recording is finished.
In addition to the BPMN uploaded to the server, a PDF containing this information will also be created locally. The X1 Process Recorder can also be used standalone without server connection, in which case the BPMN is also stored locally.
An XES file is also created for further processing in process mining tools.
